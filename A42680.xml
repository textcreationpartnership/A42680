            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <p>I am weary of my Groaning: every night waſh I my Bed, and water my Couch with my Tears.</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THIS Pſalm is intituled to <hi>David,</hi> and is ſtyled by many, One, or the Firſt, of his <hi>Penitentiall</hi> Pſalms: And it is true, it expreſſeth his Agony and dolour of mind, for his Sickneſs undoubtedly, for his Sins as the Cauſe of it in likelihood, and ſo for both; as in a Pſalm parallel to this he complains, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 38.4. which two make a heavy Burthen, too heavy for any man to bear. The Burthen of one one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (to wit, of Sin, though not his own,) made the Mighty One, the Mighty God, to ſtoop under it, when he bare the Sins of Men in his own body on the Tree: inſomuch that as in the Garden he told his Diſciples, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.38. <hi>My Soul is exceeding ſorrowfull unto death;</hi> ſo on the Croſs, he cried out in the Anguiſh of his ſpirit, <hi>Matth.</hi> 27.46. <hi>O God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>No marvel then, that holy <hi>David,</hi> though a man after God's own heart, and one that was of ſo bold and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:42122:6"/>magnanimous a ſpirit, as to encounter with a Lion and a Bear; that with the moſt gallant Courage a man ſhall likely meet with, could ſlight the proud Vaunts and Menaces of the great <hi>Goliah</hi> of <hi>Gath,</hi> and be no more affrighted by him, then as if he had been to encounter with a Child, while by faith he ſaw God for him; yet when he ſaw God againſt him, calling his Sin to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, laying Affliction on his loyns, <hi>conſuming</hi> him <hi>with the blow of his hand,</hi> that he (I ſay) ſhould ſhrink under the burthen, his ſpirit ſlag, his heart faint, and he roar and cry out like a Child, as in the words of my Text, <hi>I am weary of my Groaning,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Which words expreſs the ſad plight of <hi>David</hi> under ſome heavy Preſſure, which drew from him</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Groaning;</hi> the dolefull ſound of the Inwards, Lungs, and other of the Bowels, upon the feeling of ſome oppreſſing Burthen, Grief, or Pain, or the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of ſome expected approaching Evil. And this Groaning of <hi>David</hi> is with <hi>wearineſs,</hi> ſo exceſſive, as that it did even break his Heart.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It drew from him <hi>Tears,</hi> which are the emanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of watery moiſture from the eyes, drawn out ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by exceſſive Joy; but moſt commonly by ſad afflicting Griefs, which do not ſtupefy, but affect the Heart. Theſe Tears of <hi>David</hi> are deſcribed</p>
            <p n="1">1. By the abundance of them, They made his <hi>Bed to ſwim:</hi> they <hi>watered</hi> his <hi>Couch.</hi> Beds and Couches are Utenſills made for Reſt and Eaſe, the one in the Night, the other in the Day, when either labour, ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or other malady, makes us to betake our ſelves to them for repoſe and refreſhing. So ſaid <hi>Job</hi> in his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity, <hi>My Bed ſhall comfort me, my Couch ſhall eaſe my complaint,</hi> Job 7.13. Now to have the Bed to ſwim with Tears, to have the Couch watered with his own Tears, is a ſign of no Reſt nor Eaſe by them, and therefore of extreme remedileſs Grief.</p>
            <pb n="3" facs="tcp:42122:6"/>
            <p n="2">2. His Weeping is aggravated by the inceſſantneſs of it; <hi>in the Night,</hi> made for Reſt, and that <hi>every Night,</hi> yea, <hi>all the Night.</hi> And in the <hi>Day</hi> too, (for that is the time of uſing the Couch.) So that, as elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where he expreſſeth himſelf, he <hi>went mourning all the day long,</hi> and <hi>day and night God's hand was heavy upon</hi> him, and his <hi>moiſture was turned into the drought of Summer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But may it not be ſaid, <hi>Ad quid perditio haec?</hi> Wherefore was this waſte? what was the cauſe of this exceſſive Groaning and Weeping? <hi>Scire eſt per Cauſam ſcire:</hi> We never well underſtand a thing, till we know the Reaſon of it. Weeping and Groaning are ſometimes voluntary and of choice, when a perſon ſets himſelf to weep and groan; as when S. <hi>Peter,</hi> remembring <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s words, <hi>went out and wept bitterly,</hi> Matth. 26.75. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they are involuntary; as when the Chriſtians, <hi>Act.</hi> 20.37, 38. parted with S. <hi>Paul,</hi> they <hi>wept ſore, ſorrowing moſt of all for the word which he ſpake, that they ſhould ſee his face no more.</hi> Sometimes becauſe of Calamity, ſometimes becauſe of Sin, and ſometimes for both. Sometimes to expreſs Compaſſion, Tenderneſs and Love; as when S. <hi>Paul by the ſpace of three years ceaſed not to warn</hi> the <hi>Arians night and day with Tears, Act.</hi> 20.31. Sometimes for their own Sins and Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities; ſometimes for the Sins or Calamities, or both, of others. <hi>Chriſt,</hi> when he perceived the <hi>Phariſees</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity and hardneſs of heart, <hi>ſighed deeply in his ſpirit, Mark</hi> 8.12. when he beheld <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> he <hi>wept over it,</hi> Luk. 19.41. when he ſaw <hi>Mary</hi> weep, <hi>Chriſt groaned in the ſpirit, and was troubled,</hi> and <hi>wept</hi> upon <hi>Lazarus</hi> his buriall, <hi>Joh.</hi> 11.33, 35. <hi>Jeremiah</hi> the Prophet wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth, <hi>Oh that my head were waters, and mine eyes a fountain of tears, that I might weep day and night for the ſlain of the daughter of my people,</hi> Jer. 9.1. And Chap.
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:42122:7"/>13.17. he tells them, <hi>If ye will not hear it, my Soul ſhall weep in ſecret places for your Pride; and mine eyes ſhall weep ſore, and run down with tears, becauſe the Lord's Flock is carried away captive.</hi> Which he did abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perform, when he made his Book of <hi>Lamentations. David,</hi> Pſal. 119.136. ſaith of himſelf, <hi>Rivers of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters run down mine eyes, becauſe they keep not thy Law.</hi> And theſe indeed were charitable Tears for others.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Groaning</hi> and <hi>Weeping</hi> in my Text was for himſelf: partly naturall and involuntary, becauſe of his weakneſs, the <hi>vexing of his bones;</hi> partly volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary and of choice.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe his Affliction, whether Sickneſs or other Diſtreſs, was likely to bereave him of Life, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by deprive him of the opportunity of praiſing God among the living; in which he ſo much delighted, as to count his life a burthen to him, when he could not come to the Tabernacle to praiſe God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42.1, 2. and 48.1, 2, 3. Which is gathered from his plea why God ſhould ſave him from his preſent Malady; <hi>For</hi> (ſaith he, verſ. 5. next before my Text) <hi>in Death there is no remembrance of thee, in the Grave who ſhall give thee thanks?</hi> It ſeems he had ſome Sickneſs or other Danger which he apprehended to be mortall, (which is not related in the Books of <hi>Samuel,</hi>) and that put him upon this ſad Complaint in my Text. As in like manner <hi>Hezekiah</hi> complained in his Sickneſs, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 38.10, 11. <hi>I ſaid in the cutting off of my days, I ſhall go to the gates of the Grave; I am deprived of the reſidue of my years. I ſaid, I ſhall not ſee the Lord, even the Lord in the land of the living: I ſhall behold man no more with the inhabitants of the world.</hi> verſ. 18. <hi>For the Grave cannot praiſe thee, Death cannot celebrate thee: they that go down into the Pit cannot hope for thy truth.</hi> This then was the Grievance which made their other
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:42122:7"/>Malady ſo diſquieting to them, that it would put an end to their praiſing God on Earth.</p>
            <p>I do not queſtion whether the Patriarchs looked onely for Temporall Bleſſings, whether they believed the Immortality of the Soul, the Beatificall viſion im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after Death, the Reſurrection of the body; ſith <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. it is reſolved, that <hi>Abraham looked for a City which hath foundations, whoſe builder and maker as God,</hi> verſ. 10. that <hi>they confeſſed they were Strangers and Pilgrims upon Earth,</hi> verſ. 13. that they <hi>ſought</hi> and <hi>deſired a better Country, to wit, an Heavenly,</hi> verſ. 14, 16. that <hi>they accepted not deliverance, that they might obtain a better Reſurrection,</hi> verſ. 35. As our Lord <hi>Chriſt,</hi> Luk. 23.46. and S. <hi>Stephen,</hi> Act. 7.59. commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded their Spirits into God's hands: ſo <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 31.5. <hi>Into thine hand I commit my Spirit; thou haſt redeemed me, O Lord God of truth.</hi> Yet certain it is, whether by reaſon of their great affection to the ſolemn Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God on Earth, their expectations and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of God's Promiſes, or their imperfect umbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Twilight-knowledge of the Myſteries of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> they ſeem not to be alike apprehenſive of the Happineſs of the Soul after death, as the holy Apoſtles and Martyrs were after <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Aſcenſion; and therefore bemoan their excluſion out of the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and their privation of naturall Life, more paſſionately then ſeems to agree with the quietneſs and rejoycing which the Saints ſince <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Aſcenſion have expreſſed in their Death.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A Second Cauſe of <hi>David</hi>'s exceſſive Grief is inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated here, verſ. 7. <hi>Mine eye is conſumed becauſe of Grief, it waxeth hold becauſe of all mine Enemies:</hi> and verſ. 10. <hi>Let all mine Enemies be aſhamed and ſore vexed; let them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn and be aſhamed ſuddenly.</hi> It ſeems he apprehended they would, (or knew they did) if God took away his
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:42122:8"/>Life, inſult over him, and reproach him, for his often profeſſion of truſting in God, if God did not help him. So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42.3. <hi>My Tears have been my meat day and night, while they continually ſay unto me, Where is thy God?</hi> verſ. 9, 10. <hi>I will ſay unto God, My Rock, why haſt thou forgotten me? why goe I mourning becauſe of the oppreſſion of the Enemy? As with a Sword in my bones mine Enemies reproach me, while they ſay daily un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, Where is thy God?</hi> The vilifying of his God, and the deriding of his hope in him, was more grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous to <hi>David,</hi> then his Exile, or Sickneſs, or Death it ſelf.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Nor are we to doubt (though it be not expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the Text) that thoſe Groans and Tears of <hi>David</hi> were alſo Penitentiall, occaſioned by the Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of his Sins: for elſewhere is the like Complaint. Sin is that poiſonous Herb which made his Affliction bitter and deadly to him; like the wild Gourd, that made the Sons of the Prophets cry out, <hi>(Mors in Olla) There is death in the pot,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 4.40. Thus <hi>Pſal.</hi> 38.2, 3, 4. <hi>Thy hand preſſeth me ſore. There is no ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in my fleſh, becauſe of thine Anger: neither is there any reſt in my bones, becauſe of my Sin. For mine Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities have gone over my head; as an heavy burthen, they are too heavy for me.</hi> Pſal. 40.12. <hi>Innumerable E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils have compaſſed me about; mine Iniquities have taken hold upon me, ſo that I am not able to look up: they are more then the hairs of my head, therefore my heart faileth me.</hi> Pſal. 41.4. <hi>I ſaid, Lord, be mercifull unto me; heal my Soul, for I have ſinned againſt thee.</hi> Where he expreſſeth his Miſery, he doth often declare his Sin to be the Cauſe of it: as he prays for the removall of the one, ſo for the pardon of the other; and as he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains of the one, ſo he bewails the other. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is to be ſo conceived here, where he deſcribes
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:42122:8"/>the vehemency of his <hi>Groaning,</hi> and the redundance of his <hi>Tears;</hi> which is confirmed by that which he ſaith here, verſ. 8. <hi>Depart from me, all ye workers of Iniquity, for the Lord hath heard the voice of my weeping:</hi> which implies a penitential frame of ſpirit to have been in <hi>David,</hi> when he made this Prayer; he abandoned the ſociety of the workers of Iniquity, which is one princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal part of Repentance, ſhewing diſplicency with our ſelves for Sins committed, and reſolution to avoid the Occaſions of Sin, to which we may be tempted: there being no ſign more evident of loving Sin, then confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with the workers of Iniquity; nor any means more neceſſary to avoid it, (which is the chief part of Repentance,) then to ſhun the company of the practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers of Evil.</p>
            <p>And that his Tears were penitentiall, is intimated, in that it is ſaid they had a <hi>Voice,</hi> a praying Voice to God: which what other can it be deemed to be, then Confeſſing of Sin to God, Complaining to him of his Miſery be reaſon of it, Deprecating of his Vengeance? as verſ. 1. he expreſſed himſelf, <hi>O Lord, rebuke me not in thine Angor, neither chaſten me in thy hot Diſpleaſure.</hi> Sutably hereto he ſpeaks <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39.8, 10, 11. <hi>Deliver me from all my Tranſgreſſions; make me not a reproach to the fooliſh. Remove thy ſtroke away from me: I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed by the blow of thy hand. When thou with rebukes doſt correct man for Iniquity, thou makeſt his beauty to conſume away like a moth: Surely every man is vanity.</hi> So that hereby we may well conclude, (without much ſtraining of the Text,) That thoſe Groans and Tears were mixt, partly from the ſenſe of Affliction, and in that reſpect involuntary; partly Penitentiall, from the ſenſe of his Sin, and in that reſpect voluntary: and that he mourned (<hi>propter malum Culpae,</hi> as well as <hi>propter malum Poenae,</hi>) for the Evil of Acting as well
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:42122:9"/>as the Evil of Suffering; for both together, as being concatenate, and the one following the other. And accordingly we may hence infer theſe uſefull Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions.</p>

               <p>Be it Sickneſs, Exile, Reſtraint, or whatever other Affliction the Almighty brings a man's Sin to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance by, it will fetch Groans and Sighs from his Breaſt; Tears, Rivers of tears, from his Eye. The
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:42122:9"/>Anguiſh, the Venome of his Indignation will drink up his Spirits. Though (as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.9.) <hi>Fools make a mock of Sin: It is a ſport to a fool to doe miſchief:</hi> (Prov. 10.23.) yet the concluſion will be, when God viſits for it, <hi>Indignation and Wrath to them that are contentius, and obey not the Truth: Tribulation and Anguiſh upon every Soul of man that doeth evil,</hi> Rom. 2.8, 9. When <hi>Abner</hi> and his men, and <hi>Joab</hi> and his men, met by the Pool of <hi>Gibeon, Abner</hi> ſaid to <hi>Joab, Let the young men now ariſe, and play before us:</hi> but when they had a while been at the ſport, <hi>Abner</hi> calls to <hi>Joab,</hi> and ſays, <hi>Shall the Sword devour for ever? know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt thou not that it will be Bitterneſs in the latter end?</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.14, 26.</p>
               <p>A man never thrives by Sin: he may for a while be <hi>in great Power, flouriſh like a green Bay-tree;</hi> but in the concluſion <hi>Terrours take hold on him as waters, a Tempeſt ſtealeth him away in the night,</hi> ſaith <hi>Job,</hi> 27.20. <hi>The lips of a ſtrange woman drop as an hony-comb, and her mouth is ſmoother then oil: But her end is bitter as wormwood, ſharp as a two-edged ſword,</hi> Prov. 5.3, 4. <hi>Stolen waters are ſweet, and bread eaten in ſecret is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant,</hi> Prov. 9.17. <hi>But after the mouth is filled with gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell,</hi> Prov. 20.17. <hi>Though Wickedneſs be ſweet in a man's mouth, though he hide it under his tongue,</hi> as men uſe to doe, who would keep the taſt of Sweet-meats long with them; <hi>Yet his meat within him is turned into the Gall of Aſps. He hath ſwallowed down Riches, and he ſhall vomit them up again: God ſhall caſt them out of he Belly,</hi> ſaith <hi>Zophar,</hi> Job 20.12, 14, 15. The whole Books of the <hi>Proverbs</hi> and <hi>Job,</hi> yea and the whole Bible, are ſo full of ſuch expreſſions, as that a man ſcarce reads a Chapter, but ſomething or other occurrs to this purpoſe: yea all ſorts of Writers, ſacred and profane, have left upon record their Obſervations concerning
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:42122:10"/>the attendance of Puniſhment upon Sin; the lying of Sin at the door, when Evil is done within; the aven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging Eye of God; the Terrours that are ſubſequent, when Conſcience is awakened; the ſecret and ſilent Laſhes and Tortures of a guilty Conſcience, when Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, Trouble, the apprehenſion of Death or God's Anger ſeize on the ſpirit of a man. We need not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in <hi>Cain, Saul, Judas, Felix,</hi> and ſuch like, which the Scripture mentions; nor ſuch as <hi>Nero, Cali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gula,</hi> and others, of whom the <hi>Roman</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> Hiſtorians ſpeak; nor of <hi>Spira,</hi> and others of later Times: The Confeſſions of <hi>David,</hi> the Complaints of <hi>Job,</hi> the Lamentations of <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> yield us pregnant proofs of this Truth.</p>
               <p>Beſides the forealleged Texts, <hi>David</hi> tells us, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.3, 4, 5. that <hi>when he kept ſilence, his bones waxed old, through his Roaring all the day long. For day and night the Hand of</hi> God <hi>was heavy on him; his moiſture was turned into the drought of Summer;</hi> till he <hi>acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged his Sin.</hi> Pſal. 31.10. <hi>My ſtrength faileth becauſe of mine Iniquity.</hi> Pſal. 38.8. that he <hi>was feeble and ſore ſmitten,</hi> that he <hi>roared by reaſon of the diſquietneſs of his heart. Job</hi> ſpeaks thus to God, <hi>Job</hi> 13.26. <hi>Thou writeſt bitter things againſt me, and makeſt me to poſſeſs the Sins of my youth.</hi> And <hi>Jeremy,</hi> Lament. 1.14. <hi>The yoke of my Tranſgreſſions is bound by his hand, they are wreathed and come up upon my neck: he hath made my ſtrength to fall:</hi> and verſ. 20. <hi>Behold, O Lord, for I am in diſtreſs; my bowels are troubled, mine heart is turned within me; for I have grievouſly rebelled.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Anguiſh from the ſenſe of Sin ariſeth,</p>
               <p n="1">1. From the nature of Sin, which is really miſchievous, though ſeemingly pleaſant. Sin is of a Serpentine kind; it hath a ſmooth Skin, but a venomous Tail. <hi>The ſting of Death</hi> (ſaith S. <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>is Sin,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.56. It is a Sting,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:42122:10"/>and that deadly, though it be hidden. What <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith of the Drunkard's Cup, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.31, 32. though <hi>when the wine is red</hi> in the Glaſs, <hi>giveth its colour in the Cup, and moveth it ſelf aright,</hi> it is very delightfull; yet <hi>at laſt it will bite like a Serpent, and ſting like an Adder;</hi> is true of every Sin. There is a <hi>deceitfulneſs of Sin,</hi> which <hi>hardens</hi> men in the committing of it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.13. Men are fearleſs and ſecure while the pleaſure of Sin beguiles them; the conſequent upon it is hidden from them: they diſcern not God's Eye to be on them: they delude their Souls with blaſphemous imaginations, as if he ſaw it not, had forgotten it, were ſuch an one as themſelves. But it is otherwiſe: when he <hi>ſets their Sins in order before them,</hi> rouzes up their ſleepy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, cauſeth their Iniquities to ſtare in their faces; then they find that there is a Sting in Sin; the ſweet drink which they ſwallowed down pleaſantly, gnaws and frets their bowels, torments and corrodes their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, ſo that they ſigh and groan, and are ready to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy themſelves to be rid of that Venome which they ſo eaſily and greedily drank down before.</p>
               <p n="2">2. From the Properties of God ariſeth the Dolour that is conſequent on Sin.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Omniſcience of God, which diſcerns all the moſt hidden ways of man: which cauſed <hi>Job</hi> to ſay, Chap. 31.3, 4. <hi>Is not deſtruction to the wicked, and ſtrange puniſhment to the workers of Iniquity? Doth not he ſee my ways, and count all my ſteps?</hi> We are foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhly apt to imagine, that God ſees not through the thick Clouds, that he hath forgotten, that he regards not what we doe: and thus we befool our ſelves with ſuch devices as in the end ruine us. We are like that Bird, that puts its head in a hole, as if thereby it were ſafe from the Fowler: like Children, we wink our ſelves, and think none ſees us, becauſe we ſee
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:42122:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>none. A deceived Heart thus turns us aſide, that we cannot ſay, <hi>Is there not a Lie in my right hand? Quod nimis miſeri volunt, hoc facilè credunt.</hi> But what ſaith the Pſalmiſt? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 44.20, 21. <hi>If we have forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the name of our God, or ſtretched out our hand to a ſtrange God; Shall not God ſearch this out? for he knoweth the ſecrets of the heart.</hi> Hence doth <hi>Moſes</hi> derive the Affliction of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the Wilderneſs, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 90.7, 8. <hi>We are conſumed by thine Anger, and by thy Wrath are we troubled. Thou haſt ſet our Iniquities be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thee, our ſecret Sins in the light of thy Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The Purity of God makes God to hate Sin, and ſo not to tolerate it. <hi>Thou art of purer eyes,</hi> (ſaith the Prophet <hi>Habakkuk,</hi> 1.13.) <hi>then to behold Evil, and canſt not look on Iniquity.</hi> Though he ſees it, yet he will not ſee it: he knows it, and looks on it, yet turns a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way his face from it; as we doe, when we ſee ſome noiſome unclean thing, which we cauſe to be removed out of our ſight. And this muſt needs create Trouble. As when the Sun ſhines not on the world, Clouds and Darkneſs and Tempeſts quickly overſpread the Heavens: ſo when God hides his Face, Sorrow and Anguiſh of ſpirit take hold on mens Souls. <hi>Odium eſt Appetitus amovendi;</hi> Hatred is a deſire of removing of that which we hate from us. <hi>I hate the work of them that turn aſide, it ſhall not cleave to me,</hi> (ſaith <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 101.3.) It is much more true of God. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 5.4, 5, 6. <hi>Thou art not a God that hath pleaſure in Wickedneſs, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall Evil dwell with thee. The Fooliſh ſhall not ſtand in thy ſight; thou hateſt all workers of Iniquity. Thou ſhalt deſtroy them that ſpeak leaſing.</hi> God's Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs moves him to inflict Anguiſh on men for Sin.</p>
               <p n="3">3. So doth alſo his Truth. He hath given us a Law, and hath fenced it with many Threatnings, that it
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:42122:11"/>might not be broken. He is true in his Threatnings as well as in his Promiſes: as he is engaged to make good the one, ſo to verify the other. <hi>We are ſure</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.2.) <hi>that the Judgment of God is according to truth againſt them which commit ſuch things:</hi> and again, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.4. <hi>Let God be true, but every man a Liar; as it is written, That thou migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt be juſtified in thy ſayings, and mighteſt overcome when thou art judged,</hi> or <hi>doſt judge.</hi> God forceth the <hi>Jews</hi> to acknowledge this, when he puts the queſtion to them, <hi>Your Fathers where are they? and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets do they live for ever? But my words and my Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, which I commanded my ſervants the Prophets, did they not take hold of your Fathers? They returned and ſaid, Like as the Lord of Hoaſts thought to doe unto us, according to our ways and according to our doings, ſo hath he dealt with us,</hi> Zech. 1.5, 6.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Juſtice of God, as well as the Veracity of God, engageth God to inflict Anguiſh on men for Sin. <hi>His eyes are upon all the ways of the ſons of men, to give to them according to their ways, and according to the fruit of their doings,</hi> Jer. 32.19. He is <hi>the Judge of all the World,</hi> and therefore muſt needs <hi>doe right;</hi> as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> pleaded <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.25. <hi>That be far from thee, that the Righteous ſhould be as the Wicked.</hi> So in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner we may ſay, That be far from God, that the Wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked ſhould be as the Righteous. Yea, God complains, <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.17. thus, <hi>You have wearied the Lord with your words: yet ye ſay, Wherein have we wearied him? When ye ſay, Every one that doeth evil is good in the ſight of the Lord, and he delighteth in them; or, Where is the God of Judgment?</hi> And again, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.13. <hi>Your words have been ſtout againſt me, ſaith the Lord: yet ye ſay, What have we ſpoken ſo much againſt thee?</hi> He tells them, verſ. 15. <hi>Ye call the proud happy: yea, they that work
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:42122:12"/>Wickedneſs are ſet up; yea, they that tempt God are even delivered.</hi> See how God counts himſelf blaſphemed, when he is charged to favour Evil men, by not execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Juſtice on them. <hi>Juſtitia eſt perpetua &amp; conſtans voluntas ſuum cuique tribuendi,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Juſtinian</hi> in the beginning of his Inſtitutions;) Juſtice is a perpetual and conſtant will of giving to every one his own. And ſure, as Praiſe is due to them that doe well; ſo Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance to him that doeth evil. As <hi>Powers be ordained of God</hi> in his <hi>Miniſters</hi> to reward <hi>well-doing</hi> with <hi>praiſe;</hi> and to be <hi>revengers for wrath upon him that doeth evil, Rom.</hi> 13.4. ſo God (whoſe Deputies they are, and bear his name,) will <hi>render to every man according to his works.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. It is from the Power of God that ſuch Anguiſh befalls men for Sin, as I have aſſerted. He <hi>is great in power, and will not at all acquit the wicked,</hi> ſaith the Prophet <hi>Nahum,</hi> 1.3. <hi>Moſes</hi> therefore, having bewai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the great Devaſtation of mankind by God's Anger, that carries them away as with a Floud, breaks out into theſe words, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 90.11. <hi>Who knoweth the power of thy Anger? even according to thy fear, ſo is thy Wrath.</hi> Whereby he plainly intimates, that the Power of God makes God's rebukes for Sin extreme and intolerable. 1. Becauſe they reach to all parts of a man. He can puniſh Soul and Body, yea and <hi>caſt both into Hell-fire, Matth.</hi> 10.28. 2. He can make all or any of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures his Inſtruments of Puniſhment; he can arm the leaſt Worm for Vengeance: yea and that which makes it moſt unſupportable, he can make a man's own Spirit his Sword to wound him; and this is of all the ſoreſt; it being true which <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Prov.</hi> 18.14. <hi>The ſpirit of a man will ſuſtain his Infirmity: but a wounded ſpirit who can bear?</hi> 3. There is no way to eſcape from it, or to avoid the Affliction he will bring on a perſon;
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:42122:12"/>there being neither hiding-place where he cannot find a man, nor remote place whither his hand cannot reach, nor any auxiliary power to match or withſtand him, nor any Remedy but by him. <hi>Qui vulnera fecit, Solus Achilléo tollere more poteſt.</hi> Which brings in the Second Obſervation.</p>

               <p>To apply this then to your uſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It ſhould deterre you from ſinning againſt God. Though Sin may ſmile upon you before you commit
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:42122:13"/>it, it will bite you when you have acted it. It may ſing you a fair pleaſant Song, like a Siren; but it will deſtroy you, if it entice you thereby.

Though the Pleaſures of Sin be delightfull, yet they are poiſonous. <hi>Quiſquámne Venenum vult in Auro?</hi> Will any man venture to drink Poiſon in a golden Cup? You that are given to drink exceſſively, conſider while the Cup is at your mouth, that there will be a Cup of Wrath given you to drink, the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nome whereof will ſet your Bones on fire, and drink up your Spirits. You that are given to unclean and unlawfull Luſts of the body, if you be not afraid of the <hi>Morbus Gallicus,</hi> yet fear the Wrath of him who will judge ſuch perſons, and burn you with a more unquenchable Fire then that which conſumed <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah.</hi> You that ſo love the Mammon of Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, that you ſerve it; that regard not how you get Wealth, <hi>per fas, per nefas,</hi> by right or wrong, <hi>Rem, Rem, quocunque modo Rem,</hi> Money any way, though by Sacriledge, publick Robbery, Grinding the face of the Poor, by Bribery, Extortion, Perjury, Over-rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching in bargaining, Defrauding, Theft, or any other way; think of <hi>Zechariah</hi>'s <hi>flying Roll, the Curſe, Zech.</hi> 5.4. which God will <hi>bring forth, and it ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the houſe of the Thief, and into the houſe of him that Sweareth falſely by his Name; and it ſhall remain in his houſe,</hi> to cut off or torture the Inhabitant, and to <hi>conſume</hi> the Materials of the houſe.

Wherefore I abhor my ſelf, and repent in duſt and aſhes.</hi> Humble thy ſelf under his hand: pray to him <hi>not to rebuke thee in Anger, nor chaſten thee in his hot Diſpleaſure;</hi> but to <hi>have mercy on thee,</hi> and <hi>heal thy Soul that hath ſinned againſt him.</hi> Bring with thee penitential Groans and medicinal Tears of that <hi>Sorrow which is according to God, working Repentance to Salvation, not to be repented of:</hi> and with it Faith in <hi>the bloud of Chriſt,</hi> which <hi>cleanſeth from all Sin.</hi> And if thou come to God in this manner, doubt not but God will perform to thee what he ſaith, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.18. <hi>I have ſeen his ways, and will heal him; I will lead him alſo, and reſtore Comfort unto him and to his mourners.</hi> Amen.</p>

            <p>THIS Pſalm, or Poem <hi>de Triſtibus,</hi> is intituled to <hi>David,</hi> and contains an holy Elegy or mournfull Complaint to God concerning his preſent Affliction, whether Sickneſs, or Exile, or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever other Grievance he was under: the effect where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Groans,</hi> and thoſe <hi>uſque ad laſſitudinem,</hi> deep continued Groans, which ſhewed much Anguiſh of ſpirit he was under; <hi>I am weary with my Groaning.</hi>

                  <hi>That the want of opportunity of glorifying God, by prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of him, by commemorating his Goodneſs, exciting of and joyning with others in the celebrating his Praiſe, is
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:42122:15"/>very grievous to a perſon that is Godly, and addes to his Affliction by Sickneſs, or Exile, or other Reſtraint which he is under.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This was one Reaſon of <hi>David's Tears</hi> and <hi>Groans</hi> here. And to like purpoſe he argues with God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 30.9. when He <hi>hid his face,</hi> and himſelf <hi>was troubled; What profit is there in my bloud, when I go down to the Pit? ſhall the Duſt praiſe thee? ſhall it declare thy Truth?</hi> And <hi>Hezekiah</hi> in his Sickneſs bemoans his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition thus, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 38.10, 11. <hi>I am deprived of the reſidue of my years: I ſhall not ſee the Lord, even the Lord in the land of the living.</hi> Verſ. 18. he gives the Reaſon, why <hi>he had great bitterneſs for peace; For the Grave can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not praiſe thee, Death cannot celebrate thee: they that go down into the Pit cannot hope for thy Truth.</hi> verſ. 19. <hi>The Living, the Living, he ſhall praiſe thee.</hi> In his plea before <hi>Saul, David</hi> makes this his greateſt Grievance by reaſon of <hi>Saul</hi>'s Perſecution, that he was <hi>driven from abiding in the Inheritance of the Lord,</hi> 1 Sam. 26.19. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 84.1, 2. he expreſſeth his Affection thus; <hi>How amiable are thy Tabernacles, O Lord of hoaſts? My Soul longeth, yea even fainteth for the Courts of the Lord; my Heart and my fleſh crieth out for the living God.</hi> And as preferring the condition of the Birds be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his preſent condition in his Exile, he thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeaks God, verſ. 3. <hi>Yea, the Sparrow hath found a houſe, and the Swallow a neſt for her ſelf, where ſhe may lay her young; even thine Altars, O Lord of hoaſts, my King and my God:</hi> and then adds, verſ. 4. <hi>Bleſſed are they that dwell in thy Houſe: they will ſtill be praiſing thee;</hi> and verſ. 10. <hi>For a day in thy Courts is better then a thouſand. I had rather be a Door-keeper in the Houſe of my God, then to dwell in the Tents of wickedneſs.</hi> No Society, no Habitation, no Fare, no Pleaſure, could content <hi>David,</hi> while he was deprived of the Society
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:42122:16"/>of them that praiſed God, was kept from the Worſhip of God at his Tabernacle, debarr'd from acceſs to God, to enquire of him what he was to doe, and to addreſs his Supplications to God in his Houſe of Prayer. And the Reaſons hereof are,</p>
               <p n="1">1. From the Property of an Holy perſon, which is, to delight in Communion with God, ſo as to make God his Joy chiefly, yea, in ſome ſort ſolely: that is, though he can rejoyce in Wife, Children, Food, and other Bleſſings he hath; yet he cannot, he dares not terminate his Joys in them, but he rejoyceth in them as <hi>the gift of God,</hi> Eccles. 5.18, 19. He <hi>eats his bread with joy, and drinks his wine with a merry heart; for God accepteth his works,</hi> Eccles. 9.7. He rejoyceth in them, becauſe he hath them with God's allowance, with his favour; they <hi>are ſanctified to him by the word of God and prayer,</hi> and thereby they <hi>are good</hi> to him, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.4, 5. otherwiſe they would be <hi>unclean</hi> to him, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.15. All things are good to the Godly with the light of God's Countenance, if they can have them with his acceptance, and uſe them for his Glory. God is the principal thing in which a renewed Nature de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights: all other things are pleaſant as they come from him, and tend to him; as they ſignify to us his good will towards us, and as they are occaſions of ſhewing our love to him. <hi>Trahit ſua quemque voluptas.</hi> As carnall hearts have carnall delights; ſo a ſpirituall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon delights in the things of the Spirit of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.5. A Sow will feed on filth, a Sheep on tender ſweet graſs: So profane and ungodly men can be merry in a Tavern, in Swearing, Curſing, Singing obſcene Songs, and Invectives againſt Piety, praiſing of God, hearing his Word; but a Holy heart is weary of ſuch Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, it is a Hell to him to aſſociate with ſuch. <hi>Woe is me,</hi> ſaith <hi>David,</hi> (Pſal. 120.5.) <hi>that I ſojourn in Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſech,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:42122:16"/>that I dwell in the tents of Kedar:</hi> but, ſaith he, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 122.1, 2. <hi>I was glad when they ſaid unto me, Let us goe into the Houſe of the Lord. Our feet ſhall ſtand within thy Gates, O Jeruſalem:</hi> for there God is prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, there is an Aſſembly of them that love God, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in his Worſhip. <hi>Truly,</hi> ſaith S. <hi>John,</hi> (1 <hi>John</hi> 1.3.) <hi>our fellowſhip is with the Father, and with his Son Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> As it is the greateſt Grievance for an Epicure, a ſwiniſh, brutiſh, voluptuous, luxurious man, to be reſtrained from his Cups, wanton and ſenſuall Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and Delights: ſo it is the greateſt Grievance to good men, to be withheld from the Communion and Society of Saints, from the enjoyment of holy Ordinances, and imployment in holy Exerciſes, whereby they may honour and injoy Communion with God; becauſe they delight in God, and count all other delight as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipid, without reliſh, while they want that Intercourſe with God which makes all things ſavoury and pleaſant to them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The End of a Godly man's life is to honour God, and to promote the Service and Kingdome of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt. None of us</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.7, 8.) <hi>liveth to himſelf, and no man dieth to himſelf. For whether we live, we live unto the Lord; and whether we die, we die unto the Lord: whether we live therefore or die, we are the Lord's.</hi> Without God a Godly man's Life is not <hi>Vita vitalis,</hi> a lively Life, but rather a Dream then a Life: He doth <hi>ſenſim mori,</hi> he doth but linger, and die a lingering death. This, ſaith the Apoſtle, (<hi>Phil.</hi> 1.20, 21.) is my <hi>earneſt expectation and hope, that in nothing I ſhall be aſhamed, but that with all boldneſs, as always, ſo now alſo, Chriſt ſhall be magnified in my body, whether it be by life, or death. For to me to live is Chriſt, and to die is gain.</hi> That is, the whole gain of his life or death was <hi>Chriſt:</hi> and therefore ſo he might
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:42122:17"/>glorify him, and enjoy him, he was indifferent whether he did live or die. He was affected ſo to <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his love to him, that in his farewell ſpeech to the <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian</hi> Elders, <hi>Act.</hi> 20.22, 23, 24. he ſaith, <hi>And now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, I goe bound in the Spirit unto Jeruſalem, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the things that ſhall befall me there: Save that the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt witneſſeth in every city, ſaying that bonds and afflictions abide me. But none of theſe things move me; neither count I my life dear unto my ſelf, ſo that I might finiſh my courſe with joy, and the Miniſtry which I have received of the Lord Jeſus, to teſtify the Goſpell of the grace of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is the property of Love, <hi>not to ſeek its own things,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5. but the pleaſing and ſerving him whom he loves, and accordingly to that he loves; he regards nothing ſo much as the gratifying of his beloved, is willing to part with any thing which may be incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent therewith, imploys his faculties to the utmoſt, acts <hi>ad extremum virium,</hi> to the uttermoſt, on his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half. Love is <hi>Affect us <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nionis,</hi> an Affection of Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: the Soul of a Lover is <hi>ubi amat, non ubi animat,</hi> not where he breaths, but where he loves; which makes him long after his beloved, as <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42.1, 2. <hi>As the Hart panteth after the water-brooks, ſo panteth my Soul after thee, O God. My Soul thirſteth for God, for the living God: when ſhall I come and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear before God?</hi> And for the ſame reaſon he is not content in Exile or Sickneſs, when he cannot have op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to glorify God. As, on the other ſide, it is well with him, when he can injoy God, and doe his work, though it be with ſhipwreck of all his other Commodities: he willingly parts with all, and freely relinquiſheth them, for this end; as knowing that of our Saviour to be a neceſſary Leſſon to be learned by him, <hi>He that loveth Father or Mother more then me, is not
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:42122:17"/>worthy of me: and he that loveth Son or Daughter more then me, is not worthy of me,</hi> Matth. 10.37. and again, <hi>Luk.</hi> 14.26. <hi>If any man come unto me, and hate not his Father, and Mother, and Wife, and Children, and Brothers, and Siſters, yea and his own Life alſo, he cannot be my Diſciple.</hi> Excellent and worthy was the reſolution of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> Act. 21.13. When he was beſought not to goe up to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> becauſe of <hi>Agabus</hi> his Prophecy of his being bound at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and delivered into the hands of the Gentiles; he thus repells the motion of his moſt loving Friends, <hi>What mean ye to weep and break my heart? for I am ready not to be bound onely, but alſo to die at Jeruſalem for the Name of the Lord Jeſus.</hi> But far more excellent was the Objurgation of <hi>Chriſt</hi> to S. <hi>Peter,</hi> to whom (when he diſſuaded him from go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> to ſuffer death there) with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation he turns himſelf with this Thunder-clap, <hi>Get thee behind me, Satan, thou art an offence unto me; for thou ſavoureſt not the things that be of God, but thoſe that be of men,</hi> Matth. 16.23.</p>
               <p>And indeed, though in a far inferiour degree, ſuch is the mind of all that truly love God and the Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> They are magnanimouſly reſolved to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter with all Difficulties for Their honour; (as <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> who would goe to <hi>Wormes</hi> to witneſs his Doctrine before the Emperour, though he ſhould meet with as many Devils there as there were Tiles on the houſes of that City;) and are well contented when they part with the greateſt outward Advantages for it. As thoſe Martyrs that went to the Stake joyfully; and that Marqueſs that left the Emperour's Court, and Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment there, his Wife and Children, to injoy the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell in a Proteſtant City. And they think their Life not to be regarded but for the uſe of it in God's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. As that learned Doctour, who being diſſuaded
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:42122:18"/>from ſtudying ſo much, whereby his Life was likely to be ſhortned, and told, that it was not wiſedom <hi>perdere Subſtantiam propter Accidentia, to loſe Subſtance for Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents,</hi> meaning Life for encreaſe of Learning, and communicating it by writing, anſwered, <hi>Nec propter Vitam vivendi perdere Cauſas,</hi> that it was as unfit for him to take care of his Health, and to loſe the Uſe and End of his Life, which was the doing his work, glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying of God, and benefitting of others. (Doctour <hi>Reynolds.</hi>) Then a Holy man lives with Comfort, when he can honour God, and doe his work: but when he is ſtopped therein, then he is <hi>weary with Groaning, and waters his Couch with his Tears;</hi> as <hi>David</hi> did here for his preſent Affliction, becauſe it hindred him from the Aſſemblies, wherein he might remember and thank God: as alſo becauſe he feared the inſolent Pride of his Enemies, that they would reproach God. Which leads us to the</p>

                  <hi>That it aggravates a Godly man's Affliction, when by reaſon of his Sufferings, Reproach is likely to be caſt upon God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That the ſenſe of this was that which ſo much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted <hi>David</hi> when he penned this Pſalm, and cauſed the mournful <hi>Groans</hi> and <hi>Tears</hi> here mentioned, may be gathered from the next verſe, where he ſaith, <hi>Mine eye is conſumed becauſe of Grief, it waxeth old becauſe of all mine Enemies:</hi> and verſ. 10. <hi>Let all mine Enemies be aſhamed and ſore vexed; let them return and be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med ſuddenly.</hi> Now the Reaſon why his Enemies were ſuch a thorn in his ſide, when he was in Sickneſs or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ile, (in one of which it is likely this Pſalm was penned,) is expreſſed <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42.9, 10. thus, <hi>I will ſay unto God,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:42122:18"/>My Rock, why haſt thou forgotten me? why goe I mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning becauſe of the oppreſſion of the Enemy? As with a ſword in my bones, mine Enemies reproach me, while they ſay daily unto me, Where is thy God?</hi> God had ſent <hi>Samuel</hi> to anoint him King over <hi>Iſrael,</hi> he had promiſed to eſtabliſh the Kingdome in his Houſe, and to ſubdue all his Enemies on every ſide: of this he much gloried, even then when he fled to the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> and changed his behaviour before them; and his Enemies in <hi>Saul</hi>'s Court, or the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> inſulted over him, as if his hopes were at an end, God had <hi>caſt him off,</hi> and would <hi>be favourable no more,</hi> had <hi>forgotten to be gracious,</hi> and did <hi>fail in his promiſe,</hi> Pſal. 77.7, 8, 9. yet even then (as the Title of the Pſalm imports, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.1, 2.) he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved thus, <hi>I will bleſs the Lord at all times: his praiſe ſhall be continually in my mouth. My Soul ſhall make her boaſt in the Lord.</hi> With this his Confidence in God they were wont to upbraid him, when he was low, in ſome Sickneſs, or in a flitting Condition, or driven from <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> by his Son <hi>Abſalom:</hi> as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 3.1, 2. he complains, <hi>Lord, how are they increaſed that trouble me? many are they that riſe up againſt me. Many there be that ſay of my Soul, There is no help for him in his God.</hi> So when <hi>Shimei</hi> railed on him and curſed him, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.7, 8. The like may be gathered from paſſages in many other Pſalms; as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 7. concerning the words of <hi>Cuſh</hi> the <hi>Benjamite; Doeg</hi> the <hi>Edomite, Pſal.</hi> 52. and others. By which it may be perceived, that in his low eſtate <hi>David</hi> was more ſenſible of the Injury which might be to God's Name, then his own Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.7, 8. among other things wherein (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in reſpect of his own Condition, or prophetically deſcribing the Anguiſh of our Lord <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Soul when he ſuffered for us, of which that Pſalm is a manifeſt Prediction,) <hi>David</hi> ſets out his deplorable eſtate, he
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:42122:19"/>urgeth thus, that <hi>all that ſaw him laughed him to ſcorn, they ſhoot out the lip, they ſhake the head, ſaying, He truſted on the Lord, that he would deliver him: let him deliver him, ſeeing he delighted in him.</hi> Which being the thing done to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> Matth. 27.43. and <hi>Chriſt</hi> u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the firſt words of that Pſalm, <hi>Matth.</hi> 27.46. on the Croſs, it is evident, that as to <hi>David</hi> in the Type, ſo to <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the Antitype, this was one of the greateſt Vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations to them in their Sufferings, that they were twit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with and ſcoffingly taunted for their Truſt in God, as if it were a vain thing to call upon God, and to truſt upon him. And indeed the Apoſtle tells us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.3. that herein <hi>Chriſt pleaſed not himſelf,</hi> but it was an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to the heavy Sufferings which he underwent, that <hi>the Reproaches of them that reproached God fell on him.</hi> When <hi>Hezekiah</hi> heard of <hi>Sennacherib</hi>'s meſſage, in which he magnified himſelf, and vilified the God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> it is ſaid that <hi>he rent his cloaths, and covered himſelf with Sackcloath, and went to the Houſe of the Lord, and ſent to Iſaiah</hi> this meſſage, <hi>This day is a day of Trouble, and of Rebuke, and of Blaſphemy. It may be the Lord thy God will hear the words of Rabſhakeh, whom the King of Aſſyria his maſter hath ſent to reproach the living God:</hi> thereby ſhewing what he laid moſt to heart, that the living God ſhould be reproached. When, by reaſon of the Sin of <hi>Achan,</hi> the men of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were ſmitten by the men of <hi>Ai, Joſhua rent his cloaths, and fell to the earth upon his face, before the Ark of the Lord, untill the even-tide, he and the Elders of Iſrael, and put duſt upon their heads:</hi> and he prayed, <hi>O Lord, what ſhall I ſay, when Iſrael turneth their backs before their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies? For the Canaanites and all the Inhabitants of the Land ſhall hear of it, and ſhall environ us round, and cut off our name from the earth: and what wilt thou doe unto thy great Name?</hi> Joſh. 7.6, 8, 9. Wherein you
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:42122:19"/>may perceive, that the Sore which moſt of all vexed the ſpirit of <hi>Joſhua</hi> and the Elders of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> which made them to put on the habit of Mourners, was the Diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement likely to befall the great Name of God, if the <hi>Canaanites</hi> did prevail. In like manner <hi>Moſes,</hi> when he interceded for the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> who had provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked God to deſtroy them by their Idolatry and their Murmuring, uſeth this Argument, of the Injury that would accrue to his great Name, if he did not ſpare them; preferring God's Honour before his own Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement or Happineſs: <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.11, 12. <hi>Num.</hi> 14.13, &amp;c. Yea, the Diſhonour done to God in making the Golden Calf did ſo incenſe <hi>Moſes,</hi> that he broke the Tables of the Decalogue, and burnt the Calf, made them drink the powder of it, and ſet the <hi>Levites</hi> armed to kill the Idolaters. Memorable alſo was the carriage of <hi>Barnabas</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> Act. 14.14. When the people of <hi>Lyſtra</hi> magnified them as Gods for the healing of an impotent man, and would have ſacrificed unto them, as to <hi>Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Mercurius, they rent their cloaths, and ran in among the people, crying out, Sirs, why doe you theſe things? We are men; turn to the living God:</hi> though they were in jeopardy of being ſtoned by them. This is indeed the conſtant diſpoſition of all upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted men, that they had rather ſuffer any Indignities, Injuries, Dammages, Calamities, themſelves, then have God's Glory and Honour be eclipſed: they are willing that any Crime, Shame, Falſhood, ſhould be imputed to them, rather then the leaſt Ignominy or Diſgrace caſt on God; that their Names ſhould become odious, then God's have the leaſt blemiſh. And the Reaſons are,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe they eſteem themſelves as nothing in compariſon of God; and therefore count it a ſmall matter, what Evil befalls them, ſo that God be mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified. When <hi>Abraham</hi> beſpeaks God, he uſeth this
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:42122:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſelf-debaſing preface, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.27. <hi>Behold now, I have taken upon me to ſpeak unto the Lord, who am but duſt and aſhes:</hi> And <hi>Jacob,</hi> Gen. 32.10. <hi>I am not worthy of,</hi> or, as it is in the <hi>Hebrew, I am leſs then the leaſt of all the Mercies, and of all the Truth, which thou haſt ſhewed unto thy Servant:</hi> And <hi>Job,</hi> 40.4. <hi>Behold, I am vile, what ſhall I anſwer thee? I will lay my hand upon my mouth;</hi> Chap. 42.5, 6. <hi>Now mine eye ſeeth thee, I abhor my ſelf:</hi> And <hi>David,</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 17.16. <hi>Who am I, O Lord, and what is my houſe, that thou haſt brought me hitherto?</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.14, 15. <hi>Who am I, and what is my people, that we ſhould be able to offer ſo willingly after this ſort? For we are ſtrangers before thee, and ſojourners, as were all our Fathers: our days on the earth are as a ſhadow, and there is none abiding.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On the other ſide, they aſcribe all Greatneſs unto God. <hi>Moſes</hi> in his Song, <hi>Exod.</hi> 15.11. <hi>Who is like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee, O Lord, among the Gods? who is like thee, glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious in holineſs, fearfull in praiſes, doing wonders? Deut.</hi> 32.3, 4. <hi>Becauſe I will publiſh the Name of the Lord; aſcribe ye Greatneſs to our God. He is the Rock, his work is perfect; for all his ways are Judgment: a God of Truth, and without Iniquity, Juſt and Right is He.</hi> Pſal. 145.1, 2, 3. ſaith <hi>David, I will extoll thee, my God and my King, and I will bleſs thy Name for ever and ever. Every day will I bleſs thee, and I will praiſe thy Name for ever and ever. Great is the Lord, and greatly to be praiſed; and his Greatneſs is unſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chable. The four living Creatures reſt not day and night, ſaying, Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God Almighty, which was, and is, and is to come.</hi> They <hi>give glory and honour and thanks to him that ſitteth on the Throne, who liveth for ever.</hi> And <hi>the four and twenty Elders fall down be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him that ſate on the Throne, who liveth for ever and ever; and caſt their Crowns before the Throne, ſaying,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:42122:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory, and honour, and power: for thou haſt created all things, and for thy pleaſure they are and were created,</hi> Rev. 4.8, 9, 10, 11. Many more ſuch expreſſions there are in the Songs of <hi>Hannah,</hi> the bleſſed Virgin, the 14000 Virgins, and other Hymns of the Saints in the Old and New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which do fully ſhew, that this is the conſtant diſpoſition of all Holy hearts, to nullify all their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency, when it is compared with God; and to extoll the Name of God as infinitely exceeding all created Beings: and therefore they conceive it moſt equall, that they ſhould count the Diſparagement of God as a more heavy Affliction then their own Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They know that God's Name is moſt tenderly regarded by him. <hi>Num.</hi> 14.21. the Lord ſaid, <hi>Truly as I live, all the Earth ſhall be filled with the Glory of the Lord.</hi> Deut. 32.26, 27. <hi>I ſaid, I would ſcatter them into corners, I would make the remembrance of them to ceaſe from among men; Were it not that I feared the wrath of the Enemy, leſt their Adverſaries ſhould behave themſelves ſtrangely, and ſay, Our hand is high, and the Lord hath not done all this.</hi> Iſa. 42.8. <hi>I am the Lord, that is my Name, and my Glory will I not give to another, neither my Praiſe to graven Images.</hi> Iſa. 48.11. <hi>For mine own ſake, even for mine own ſake will I doe it; for how ſhould my Name be polluted? and I will not give my Glory to another.</hi> Ezek. 20.9. <hi>But I wrought for my Name's ſake, that it ſhould not be polluted before the Heathen, among whom they were, in whoſe ſight I made my ſelf known unto them.</hi> In the Third Commandment, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.7. God chargeth, <hi>Thou ſhalt not take the Name of the Lord thy God in vain: for the Lord will not hold him guiltleſs that taketh his Name in vain.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Godly are ſenſible of his Glory above their
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:42122:21"/>own Peace; and more affected with any dirt caſt on God's face, then any wound given to their own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They know it is the Duty of all created Beings, to prefer their Maker, their Father, their King and Lord, before themſelves. They know they are enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to <hi>fear this glorious and fearfull Name, The Lord their God,</hi> Deut. 28.58. as <hi>the Father that begat them, the Rock that formed them,</hi> Deut. 32.6, 15, 18. When S. <hi>John</hi> would have worſhipped the Angel, he forbade him, <hi>See thou doe it not; for I am thy fellow-ſervant, and of thy brethren, the Prophets, and of them which keep the ſayings of this Book: worſhip God,</hi> Rev. 22.9. As <hi>David</hi>'s people counted their King (as all good Subjects do) <hi>worth ten thouſand of themſelves,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18.3. and all honeſt Servants count their Maſter's Wel-fare and Credit far before their own, yea his Life before their own: ſo do all Holy perſons God's Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as being their Maſter, their Father, their King. <hi>Croeſus</hi> his Son, that never ſpake before, opened then his mouth, and ſaid, <hi>Kill not King Croeſus,</hi> when a Souldier was about to ſlay him. So will every Child of God be moved, when his heavenly Father is blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemed, and his Name ſtricken through; though he be ſilent when himſelf is abuſed. <hi>Chriſt</hi> bids us pray, <hi>Our Father, which art in Heaven, Hallowed be thy Name,</hi> before he directs us to pray, <hi>Give us this day our daily bread, And forgive us our debts.</hi> The Relation of Creatures, Children, Subjects and Servants to God, oblige every Holy perſon to mind and ſeek the ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of God's Name, though it be with never ſo great diminution and detriment to himſelf.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And laſtly, They know that thus doing, they ſhall beſt provide for themſelves. When <hi>David</hi> was <hi>little in his own eyes, God choſe him to be head of his
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:42122:21"/>people Iſrael.</hi> He knew it to be true which God ſaid to <hi>Eli,</hi> 1 Sam. 2.30. <hi>Them that honour me, I will honour; and they that deſpiſe me ſhall be lightly eſteemed.</hi> As all Princes of worth will reward their loyal Subjects, all good Parents their dutifull Children, all wiſe Maſters their obedient Servants: ſo God will doe to all his true-hearted Subjects, Children, and Servants. And this makes them regardleſs of themſelves in compariſon of God, as knowing, that they beſt provide for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, when they are careleſs of their own Eſtates, but moſt carefull of his Glory.</p>

               <p n="1">1. We may hereby judge of what ſpirit they are, who neither in Sickneſs nor Health, Adverſity nor Proſperity, are affected with the Worſhip of God, with the Diſhonour or Honour that is done to his Name. Sure they have not the Heart of <hi>David,</hi> who <hi>groaned unto wearineſs, all the night made his Bed to ſwim,</hi> and <hi>watered his Couch with his Tears,</hi> becauſe he wanted the opportunity of remembring God, of giving him thanks in his Sanctuary, by reaſon of his Sickneſs or Exile: in which he was moſt afraid leſt his Enemies ſhould be highly injurious to God, in ſpeaking evil of him; was leſs ſenſible of his own Suffering. They who, well or ill, mind not to repair to the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies to praiſe God; that are no whit moved by the taking of God's Name in vain, or the blaſpheming of him, if ſo be they may be quiet, live at eaſe, in wealth, in content. They are undoubtedly of a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villiſh ſpirit, that are enemies to the praiſing of God, that inveigh againſt and oppoſe the ſolemn Service and Worſhip, in holy Prayer, Praiſes of God, Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching and Hearing of his moſt holy Word; that deride
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:42122:22"/>thoſe things, and deterre men from them. Much more damnable is their practice who glory in the profaning of the glorious Name of the Almighty God; who make it their ſport and their gallantry to abuſe the High and Holy one in vain and falſe Swearing, in dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Blaſphemies and Curſes, in impious Atheiſtical Jeſts and Scoffs: which I wiſh were onely outlandiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour, that could, as heretofore, be charged onely on <hi>Italianated, Hiſpaniolized</hi> Papiſts; that it were not the faſhion of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Proteſtants, who ſeem often to pray, <hi>Hallowed be thy Name,</hi> and when the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Firſt Table are read, to ſay, <hi>Lord, have mercy upon us, and incline our hearts to keep theſe Laws;</hi> yet neither have God for their God, nor regard his Worſhip, nor hallow his Name, nor ſanctifie his Day, but pollute all with their impure Tongues and foul Feet. Oh that you that are guilty of ſo doing would tremble at the Damnation due to theſe Sins; and you who are not guilty would mourn for theſe Abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in others, and be affected as <hi>David</hi> was, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.136. <hi>Rivers of waters run down mine eyes, becauſe they keep not thy Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. If God bring Sickneſs or any other Affliction upon you, let this be a Grievance to you, that you cannot be with them that are imployed in God's Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip: when you are in Health, at Liberty, in Peace, omit not to wait on God in his ſolemn Service. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider how unworthy a thing it is, to mind your own things, as if you owed nothing to God, from whom you have All: to forget that He is your Maker, the Father that begat you, your King, your Lord, your God, who is good, kind, and mercifull to you. Let the thoughts of God be dear to you, his Name precious. Be affected like <hi>David,</hi> who could not be contented to <hi>dwell in a houſe of Cedar,</hi> when <hi>the Ark of God dwelt
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:42122:22"/>within Curtains,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.2. Be willing to further God's Honour, and the Knowledge of him, more then to furniſh your own Houſes, adorn your own Backs, and make proviſion for your own Tables. Let them be your beſt Friends that glorifie God moſt; and thoſe your Enemies, that take his Name in vain. And let your Sighs and Tears be as much for neglecting God's Service, as for omitting the purſuance of your own Ends, your own Preferments, Pleaſures, Profits. In a word, where you can, endeavour to recover ſuch from their Profaneneſs and Ungodlineſs, who mind not his Worſhip, or pollute his Name by any profane ſpeeches or behaviour: pluck them as Brands out of the fire, with holy zeal for God, and compaſſion to them. And if you cannot amend them, yet <hi>mourn</hi> for them, (as <hi>Samuel</hi> did for <hi>Saul,</hi> when God was departed from him, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.35.)

            <p>THIS Verſe hath held us twice already. Inquiry being made of the Cauſe of ſuch exceſſive Grief as is here expreſſed; it hath been reſolved, That not onely Pain of Body, or Bodily Reſtraint, drew out ſuch Groans, ſuch a Fountain of Tears as was let out when this Pſalm was made: Privation of God's Worſhip, fear of the Diſhonour that might ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crue to God from his Enemies, Reproaching God by reaſon of him, are intimated verſ. 5, 7, 10. to have been likewiſe Cauſes of this immoderate Sorrow. And accordingly I have already handled theſe four Points.</p>

            <p>Thus far we have proceeded. There is <hi>plus ultrà,</hi> ſomewhat more to be gathered from this Flower.</p>
            <p>Commonly this Pſalm is ſtyled One, or the Firſt of the <hi>Penitentiall</hi> Pſalms. And that theſe <hi>Groans</hi> and <hi>Tears</hi> were for Sin, hath been gathered partly from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parallel places, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 38.1, 2, 3, 4. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39.11. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40.12. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 41.4. and others: from the Prayer here, verſ. 1. wherein he acknowledgeth his preſent Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, <hi>Rebukes</hi> and <hi>Chaſtening,</hi> from God, and therefore for Sin; and verſ. 8. aſcribes an audible <hi>Voice</hi> to his <hi>weeping,</hi> which argues his Tears were for Sin, and with Supplication for its Pardon.

               <item>5. <hi>That Affliction brings Sin to Remembrance; and that the Groans and Tears and Diſquietneſs of an Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perſon under his Affliction are as well or more for his Sins, then for his Sufferings.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>That Affliction brings Sin to Remembrance; and that the Groans and Tears and Diſquietneſs of an Holy perſon under his Affliction are as well or more for his Sins, then for his Sufferings.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:42122:24"/>
               <p n="1">1. That Affliction brings Sin to Remembrance, is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt by many Inſtances. When the Sons of <hi>Jacob</hi> were in ſtreights by reaſon of <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s ſeeming rough dealing with them in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and his impriſoning one of them; then they remembred their Sin, which it ſeems they minded not before: <hi>Gen.</hi> 42.21. <hi>And they ſaid one to another, We are verily guilty concerning our Brother, in that we ſaw the anguiſh of his Soul, when he beſought us, and we would not hear: therefore is this diſtreſs come upon us.</hi> When <hi>Adonibezek</hi> was caught, and his Thumbs and great Toes cut off, he could then remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, <hi>Threeſcore and ten Kings, having their Thumbs and great Toes cut off, gathered their meat under my Table: as I have done, God hath requited me,</hi> Joſ. 1.7. The Widow of <hi>Sarepta</hi> that entertained <hi>Elijah</hi> the Prophet, when her Son was dead, expreſſed her ſelf in a fit of paſſion to <hi>Elijah, What have I to doe with thee, O thou man of God? art thou come unto me to call my Sin to remembrance, and to ſlay my Son?</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 17.18. Even holy <hi>Job,</hi> though an <hi>upright and perfect man, one that feared God, and eſchewed evil,</hi> yet in the time of his Affliction complains, that God did <hi>write bitter things againſt him, and made him to poſſeſs the Iniquities of his youth,</hi> Job 13.26. When <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> was bound in fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and carried to <hi>Babylon,</hi> then he <hi>humbled himſelf greatly before the God of his Fathers,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 33.11, 12. When <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that ſlighted the many Warnings of the Prophets that were ſent to her, was taken by <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> and the people carried captive to <hi>Babylon,</hi> then they could <hi>remember</hi> that they had <hi>grievouſly ſinned,</hi> and therefore <hi>were removed,</hi> Lament. 1.7, 8.</p>
               <p>And indeed, this is the very End of God's Afflictions, to bring mens Sins into Remembrance. In their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity men are ſecure, they mind their Pleaſures, think
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:42122:25"/>not of the Reckoning; they are like men that are filled with Wine, faſt aſleep, and heed not what is ſaid of them, or to them, or what is near them, or inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to be done to them: and ſo are not moved at all by any Counſells or Warnings given them by God or man. When Wiſedome <hi>calls,</hi> they <hi>refuſe</hi> to hearken; when ſhe <hi>ſtretcheth out her hands, no man regards it: their Proſperity deſtroys them,</hi> Prov. 1.24, 32. Yea, <hi>becauſe ſentence againſt an evil work is not executed ſpeedily, therefore the heart of the ſons of men is fully ſet in them to doe evil,</hi> Eccles. 8.11. And therefore as men uſe to doe when a perſon is thus aſleep, and the houſe is on fire, or an Enemy is coming, they jog and pinch, and, if need be, whip and ſcourge and beat ſuch a drowzy perſon to awaken him, that he may eſcape the fire or the ſword, that he may perceive his folly and his danger: ſo doth God deal with men that ſin, even the beſt, when they abuſe their Proſperity ſo as to grow ſecure in Sin, or to become dull and ſluggiſh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the work God requires of them; he viſits them with ſome Affliction or other, which may bring their Sin to mind; he <hi>hedgeth up their way with thorns, and makes a wall, that they may not find their paths,</hi> as it is <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.6. What the Lord often inculcates to us concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning our Children, he is not wanting to obſerve towards his own. He tells us that <hi>Fooliſhneſs is bound in the heart of a Child; but the Rod of Correction ſhall drive it far from him,</hi> Prov. 22.15. <hi>The Rod of Reproof gives wiſedom; but a Child left to himſelf bringeth his Mother to ſhame,</hi> Prov. 29.15. And therefore he often char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth Parents to correct their Children. <hi>Correct thy Son, and he ſhall give thee reſt; yea he ſhall give delight unto thy ſoul,</hi> Ibid. verſ. 17. <hi>Chaſten thy Son while there is hope; and let not thy Soul ſpare for his Crying,</hi> Prov. 19.18. Yea he ſaith, <hi>Prov.</hi> 13.24. <hi>He that ſpareth his Rod
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:42122:25"/>hateth his Son: but he that loveth him, chaſteneth him betimes.</hi> And accordingly the Lord, who is wiſe, and knows how to handle his own Children, when he doth perceive them careleſs, and heedleſs of their Duty, ſecure in their Sin, ſets their Sin before them, making it legible by ſome Correction; that they may diſcern their Fault by their Puniſhment, and being humbled for the one, may remove the other. <hi>As many as I love,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Chriſt,</hi>) <hi>I rebuke and chaſten,</hi> Revel. 3.19. Which is no other then what the Authour of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> (12.5, 6.) tells them; <hi>My Son, deſpiſe not thou the Chaſtening of the Lord, nor faint when thou art rebuked of him. For whom the Lord loveth he chaſteneth, and ſcourgeth every Son whom he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth.</hi> Which is the ſame that <hi>Solomon</hi> had ſaid, <hi>My Son, deſpiſe not the Chaſtening of the Lord, neither be weary of his Correction. For whom the Lord loveth he correcteth, even as a Father the Son in whom he deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth,</hi> Prov. 3.11, 12. And before him <hi>Eliphaz</hi> in <hi>Job,</hi> (5.17.) <hi>Behold, happy is the man whom God correcteth: therefore deſpiſe not thou the Chaſtening of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The nature of all the Afflictions which God inflicts on any is Caſtigation, or Vindication. It was not for any ſpecial Sin of the Child or Parents, that the man mentioned <hi>Joh.</hi> 9.2, 3. was born blind; nor that <hi>Job</hi> was under ſo many Calamities as we reade of, was it becauſe of any preſumptuous Sin that he was chargea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with: but that in the one <hi>the works of God might be made manifeſt in him;</hi> in the other, that his Since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity might be tried, that he did not ſerve God for his outward Proſperity. Yet there was Sin in them, and one Uſe of thoſe Viſitations was to ſhew the Evil of Sin. All God's punitive Acts are Judgments; even his own Children are judged for Sin: though <hi>when they
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:42122:26"/>are judged, they are chaſtened of the Lord, that they might not be condemned with the world,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.32. Though the Avengement or vindictive Satisfaction be laid on <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſo as that he <hi>bears the Iniquities</hi> of his Children; yet their own Sufferings are from God's Juſtice, occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned by their Sins as the impulſive cauſe, though not intended in Satisfaction to his Juſtice as the final cauſe. Hence it is that ſome are ſo blinded, that <hi>when the Hand of God is lifted up, they will not ſee,</hi> Iſa. 26.11. And ſome, when they have <hi>been ſtricken, have not grieved,</hi> when <hi>conſumed, have refuſed to receive Correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> have <hi>made their faces harder then a Rock,</hi> have <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to return;</hi> have been ſo <hi>fooliſh,</hi> as <hi>not to know the way of the Lord, nor the Judgment of their God,</hi> Jerem. 5.3, 4. Yet ſo much effect hath natural <hi>Conſcience</hi> had even in Infidels, that it hath <hi>accuſed or excuſed them between themſelves,</hi> that they have <hi>judged others;</hi> as <hi>knowing the Judgment of God, that they who do commit</hi> great enormous Crimes <hi>are worthy of death,</hi> Rom. 1.32. and 2.1, 15. Even the barbarous people, <hi>Act.</hi> 28.4. were ſo acquainted with God's avenging Juſtice, that when they ſaw a Viper on S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s hand, they ſaid among themſelves, <hi>No doubt this man is a Murtherer, whom, though he hath eſcaped the Sea, yet Vengeance ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth not to live.</hi> And always thoſe who have acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with God become ſenſible of his Hand: as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> Pſal. 119.120. ſaith of himſelf, <hi>My fleſh trembleth for fear of thee, and I am afraid of thy Judgments.</hi> And it moves them to be affected more with their Sin then their Sufferings, which is next to be conſidered.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the pious Penitent perſon is more afflicted by reaſon of his Sin, then his Sufferings; that his Groa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and Tears are from the ſenſe of his own Diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing God, more then from the ſenſe of the Pain which God inflicts on him; is apparent from the Inſtances we
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:42122:26"/>have of ſuch Penitent perſons. In <hi>David</hi>'s peniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Complaints, it is his Sin that he ſtill complains of. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 31.10. <hi>My life is ſpent with grief, and my years with ſighing: my ſtrength faileth becauſe of mine Iniquity, and my bones are conſumed.</hi> Pſal. 38.3, 4. <hi>There is no ſoundneſs in my fleſh, becauſe of thine Anger; neither is there any reſt in my bones, becauſe of my Sins. For mine Iniquities are gone over my head; as an heavy burthen, they are too heavy for me.</hi> He ſaith not his <hi>Pain</hi> was too heavy a Burthen for him, but his <hi>Iniquity:</hi> which is indeed ſo heavy a Burthen, that the Shoulders of <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf, the Lord of Glory, were ſo preſſed with it, as to make him cry out, <hi>My Soul is heavy unto the death;</hi> and, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> Again, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40.12. he bemoans his caſe, that <hi>innumerable Evils had compaſſed him about; his Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties had taken hold upon him, ſo that he was not able to look up: they were more then the hairs of his head, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his heart failed him.</hi> It was not by reaſon of the multitude of his <hi>Evils,</hi> but the multitude of his <hi>Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi> that his heart failed him.</p>
               <p>Outward Evils reach but the outward man: Sins remembred lie heavy on the Conſcience. Now, as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, (<hi>Prov.</hi> 18.14.) <hi>The ſpirit of a man will ſuſtain his Infirmity; but a wounded ſpirit who can bear?</hi> Thoſe Philoſophers that could endure the greateſt Tortures of body, inflicted by cruel Tyrants, while they had <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

                  </gap>, Tranquillity of mind within; yet could not bear the leaſt Pain, when the Conſcience of ſome foul Evil haunted them. A great Burthen will be born by a whole Shoulder; but the leaſt Burthen pains intolerably when the Bone is broken, or it lies on a Sore place. <hi>A broken ſpirit drieth up the bones, Prov.</hi> 17.22. <hi>My Sin,</hi> ſaith <hi>David, is ever before me:</hi> and that brake his Bones. Where Sin (as it is ſaid of
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:42122:27"/>
                  <hi>Antipheron Oretanus,</hi> that his Shadow was always before him) is ſtill before a man, it haunteth and vexeth him as a Hornet: or, as the Poets feign of the Furies, which the Oratour interprets of a guilty Conſcience, it ſtill affrights him. <hi>Lament.</hi> 1.14. <hi>The yoke of my Tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions is bound by his hand.</hi> The yoke they felt, they term <hi>the yoke of</hi> their <hi>Tranſgreſſions;</hi> intimating, that by reaſon of their Tranſgreſſions, their Afflictions were as <hi>a yoke bound by God's hand,</hi> and <hi>wreathed,</hi> and <hi>came upon their neck.</hi> And in like manner, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 64.5, 6, 7. the afflicted Penitents pour out their Souls before God thus: <hi>Behold, thou art wroth, for we have ſinned. We all do fade as a leaf, and our Iniquities, as the wind, have taken us away. Thou haſt hid thy face from us, and conſumed us, becauſe of our Iniquities.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Herein there lies a great difference between the Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of a meer Natural man, and one Renewed or Regenerated by the Spirit of God. The one complains of his Pain, of his hard Fortune, his ill Luck; he frets and vexeth at his Diſappointment; his Sighs and Groans are, that he is croſt, and cannot have his will; he imputes his Miſery to Chance, Stars, and the like. If he weep, as <hi>Eſau,</hi> it is not for his Profaneneſs, but for his miſſing the Bleſſing: <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.16, 17. His Crying and Bitterneſs of ſpirit is not to God, but <hi>Iſaac, Gen.</hi> 27.34. with a murtherous mind towards <hi>Jacob,</hi> verſ. 42. <hi>Cain</hi> tells God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.13, 14. <hi>My Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is greater then I can bear. Behold, thou haſt dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven me out this day from the face of the earth, and from thy face ſhall I be hid, and I ſhall be a Fugitive and a Vagabond in the earth; and it ſhall come to paſs, that every one that ſindeth me ſhall flay me.</hi> Not a word that ſhewed his Repentance for his devilliſh act in murthering his Brother. It is otherwiſe with the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent. S. <hi>Peter goes out, and weeps bitterly,</hi> not for
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:42122:27"/>his Danger, but for his Sin. The Regenerate bemoan their ſinfull Corruptions, not their Sufferings. S. <hi>Paul,</hi> that could <hi>take pleaſure in Afflictions and Reproaches,</hi> yet <hi>groans in his earthly Tabernacle</hi> by reaſon of the Sin that dwelled in him.</p>
               <p>This indeed is the nature of true Repentance, it begetteth a <hi>Sorrow after God,</hi> ſuch as produceth <hi>Care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, Self-clearing, Indignation, Fear, vehement Deſire, Zeal, Revenge;</hi> as they are ſaid to be in the <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.11. When they <hi>remember their ways and their doings, wherein they have been defiled,</hi> true Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting perſons will not inveigh againſt others, cry out of their Deſtiny, nor cenſure others, or impute their Evils to forrein Cauſes; but take ſhame to themſelves, and <hi>loath themſelves in their own ſight, for all their Evils that they have committed,</hi> Ezek. 20.43. And the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon hereof is, becauſe it is their Sin which is indeed their Evil. It is that which is ſimply Evil; their Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction is but <hi>Malum ſecundùm quid,</hi> Evil in ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, Evil that hath ſomething of Good in it, and which tends to ſome Good; not onely to God's Glory and other Warning, but alſo to his own good who is afflicted, by humbling and bettering him that is truly Penitent. <hi>It is good for me that I have been af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted,</hi> ſaith <hi>David, that I might learn thy Statutes.</hi> It is Sin that is the cauſe of all the Miſery he feels, and therefore that muſt be more evil then his Miſery. If a Potion be bitter by reaſon of Gall and Wormwood; the Gall and Wormwood that makes it ſo muſt be more bitter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thine own Wickedneſs ſhall correct thee, and thy Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſliding ſhall reprove thee: know therefore and ſee, that it is an evil thing and bitter, that thou haſt forſaken the Lord thy God, and that my fear is not in thee, ſaith the Lord God of hoaſts</hi> to the <hi>Jews,</hi> Jerem. 2.19. And
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:42122:28"/>indeed this is the onely way for remedy of Afflictions, to be ſenſible of the Sin more then the Sufferings; to groan and ſhed Tears becauſe we have offended God, not onely becauſe we have brought Trouble on our ſelves. It is the way to take away the Cauſe of the Evil, and ſo the Bitterneſs of the Affliction. Death it ſelf, were it not for the Sting of Sin, could not harm us: take away the Conſcience of Sin, and the weight of our Sufferings will be removed. If Sin be forgiven, if the <hi>Conſcience</hi> be <hi>purged from dead works,</hi> either God will take away the Rod, or the Smart of it. Now the onely way to effect that is, to be affected with the Sin, and to loath it, to be weary of it, more then the preſſure of the Croſs. If we take any other courſe, though we <hi>houl on our Beds,</hi> though we ſhould be <hi>weary with Groaning</hi> every night, and <hi>all the night make our Bed ſwim, and water our Couch with Tears;</hi> though we ſhould wear Sackcloath, caſt Aſhes on our heads, creep to a Croſs, whip our ſelves naked, go on Pilgrimage to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> to weep at <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Sepulchre; this would make but a palliated Cure, our Wound would not be healed at the bottom, but it would fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and break out again, and gangrene, and become mortall.

               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:42122:28"/>
               <p>There was a Prayer in <hi>David</hi>'s Tears, and that God heard. And we may ſee how effectual this courſe is by the example of <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> King of <hi>Judah,</hi> who <hi>did evil in the ſight of the Lord, like unto the Abominations of the Heathen, whom the Lord caſt out before the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Iſrael:</hi> yea, <hi>he made Judah and the inhabitants of Jeruſalem to erre, and to doe worſe then the Heathen. And the Lord ſpake unto Manaſſeh, and to his people; but they would not hearken. And the Lord brought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them the Captains of the hoaſt of the King of Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyria, which took Manaſſeh amongſt the thorns, and bound him with fetters, and carried him to Babylon. And when he was in Affliction, he beſought the Lord his God, and humbled himſelf greatly before the God of his Fathers, and prayed unto him: and he was intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of him, and heard his ſupplication, and brought him again to Jeruſalem into his Kingdom. Then Manaſſeh knew that the Lord he was God,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 33.2, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13.</p>
               <p>By which Inſtance we may perceive what is the right courſe to be taken by any one whom God af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts for Sin; he is to ſeek the Lord, to humble him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf greatly, and to make his Supplication: alſo how efficacious a way this is to remove the greateſt Evils from the greateſt Tranſgreſſours. Nor is this Caſe of <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> a ſingular Caſe, but ſuch as other paſſages of Holy Scripture warrant us to make a common Rule of, both for Duty, and for Succeſs. For Duty, thus ſaith <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> Lament. 3.39, 40, 41, 42. <hi>Wherefore doth a living man complain, a man for the puniſhment of his Sins? Let us ſearch and try our ways, and turn again unto the Lord. Let us lift up our heart with our hands unto God in the Heavens. We have tranſgreſſed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belled, and thou haſt not pardoned.</hi> For Succeſs, thus ſpeaks <hi>Elihu,</hi> Job 33.27, 28. <hi>He looketh upon men,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:42122:29"/>and if any ſay, I have ſinned, and perverted that which was right, and it profited me not; He will deliver his Soul from going into the Pit, and his life ſhall ſee the light.</hi> For both, the Prophet <hi>Joel</hi> ſpeaks thus, (2.12, 13.) <hi>Therefore alſo now ſaith the Lord, Turn you even unto me with all your heart, and with faſting, and wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, and with mourning; And rend your heart, and not your garments, and turn unto the Lord your God: for he is gracious and mercifull, ſlow to anger, and of great kindneſs, and repenteth him of the Evil.</hi> Whence may be gathered,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That Complaints of our Puniſhments without Complaint of our Sins are vain and fruitleſs. It was to no purpoſe for living men to complain of the Evils they felt, while they were inſenſible of the Evils they did: for in ſo doing they juſtified not God in his Judgments on them, nor ſhewed any hatred of their own evil ways: but either were inſenſible of their Afflictions as from God's hand, and ſo gave him not the Glory of his Avenging act; or being ſenſible, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted God as an Enemy, dealing unrighteouſly with them, as not deſerving it, and fretting againſt the Lord in heart, or <hi>blaſpheming</hi> his Name <hi>becauſe of their Plagues,</hi> as thoſe mentioned <hi>Revel.</hi> 16.11.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the wiſeſt and moſt ſucceſsfull courſe that any can take in the time of God's Scourge upon them, is, to <hi>ſearch and try their ways,</hi> that is, to find out their Sins; which, till they be diſcovered, will be like <hi>Achan</hi>'s Theft, which cauſed <hi>Iſrael</hi> to fall before the <hi>Canaanites.</hi> For if God ſet our Sins before him, and we do not ſet them before our ſelves, his <hi>Anger</hi> will <hi>burn</hi> us <hi>like fire,</hi> and we know not where to caſt wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to <hi>quench</hi> it.</p>
               <p>I confeſs, there are ſome Errours that we cannot find out: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.12. <hi>Who can underſtand his Errours?</hi>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:42122:29"/>And for thoſe, though we underſtand them not, we may eſcape Vengeance, if we know them in general, are ſenſible that we have a vicious or imperfect Nature, ignorant, and heedleſs of what we ſhould know and doe. Yet thoſe we ſhould not be ignorant of, nor ſlight them as Peccadillo's, Venial ſins in their own nature. S. <hi>Paul</hi> doubtleſs cried out of theſe, even the firſt motions of Concupiſcence, without Conſent, his very Luſtings, which he hated: <hi>The Evil he would not doe, that he did; the Law in his Members warring againſt the Law of his Mind;</hi> as a <hi>body of Death,</hi> which made him <hi>wretched,</hi> and of which he enquires, <hi>Who ſhall deliver me from it?</hi> When <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks of his Sins as <hi>exceeding the hairs of his head,</hi> doubtleſs he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends his Omiſſions, his imperfect Performances of Duties, Praying with diſtraction, Praiſing God with coldneſs, Hearing without attention of mind, giving Alms with ſelf-reſpect, the Mixtures of Evil with what was Good, his Vanity of thoughts, his Ignorance, Inco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitancy, Exceſs in words, Jeſts, Merriments, and thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of ſuch Failings; which though each of them be little, yet the Multitude of them made them too heavy a Burthen for him. Though Sand be but a ſmall thing, yet Heaps of it may ſink a Ship. So though Sins of Errour be but ſmall, yet being many, they are to be known at leaſt in the general, though we be ignorant of each particular. And accordingly <hi>David,</hi> when he had ſaid, <hi>Who can underſtand his Errours,</hi> adds, <hi>Cleanſe thou me from ſecret Faults.</hi> Theſe the Penitent muſt crave Pardon for, and therefore take notice that he is guilty of them, though he cannot make a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Confeſſion of them. S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> often urgeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> that no man in this life is perfect, without Sin, becauſe <hi>Chriſt</hi> teacheth us to pray, as for our <hi>daily Bread</hi> each day, ſo for <hi>Forgiveneſs of Sins</hi>
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:42122:30"/>each day: thereby intimating, that in the beſt, who call God Father, there are <hi>Peccata quotidianae incurſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionis,</hi> Sins of daily incurſion, (as <hi>Tertullian</hi> called them,) which have need of Pardon; and that this muſt be begg'd of God. <hi>Pelagian</hi>

We are to charge our ſelves with Sin in our daily Actions, yea to count all our Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as an Unclean thing: yet that which we ſhould e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially conſider, ſhould be our open and ſcandalous Sins, as bringing moſt Diſhonour to God, and being moſt pernicious to our ſelves.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In time of God's exerciſing his punitive Juſtice, we ſhould Confeſs our Sins to God, and complain of our ſelves to him. <hi>He that hideth his Sins ſhall not proſper: but whoſo confeſſeth and forſaketh them ſhall have mercy,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon,</hi> Prov. 28.13. Auricular Confeſſion to a Prieſt, as the Papiſts teach it, is but an Invention of men for their advantage; but Confeſſion to God is a Duty neceſſary for our Salvation: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in eſpecially the Sin which God ſeems to point out by his Judgment is moſt freely to be acknowledged. As <hi>Joſhua</hi> ſaid to <hi>Achan,</hi> Joſh. 7.19. <hi>My ſon, give, I pray thee, Glory to the Lord God of Iſrael, and make Confeſſion unto him, and tell what thou haſt done.</hi> Thus doe all truly Penitent perſons in their Afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: and this is the way to recover out of their Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, if they deal plainly with God and Men.</p>
               <p n="4">4. To which, fourthly, it is neceſſary ſhould be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Sorrow of heart, a contrite, broken and rended heart, Compunction of ſpirit, Remorſe of Conſcience for what we have done: and in ſome ſpeciall caſes, when the hand of God is ſore upon us, and our Sin
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:42122:30"/>hath been eminently great, there muſt be Faſting, Weeping and Mourning for our Sins; yea the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance and continuance of his Tears, <hi>David</hi> ſaith hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perbolically, <hi>watered his Couch, made his Bed to ſwim, every</hi> or <hi>all the Night,</hi> with <hi>Groans</hi> unutterable, even unto <hi>wearineſs.</hi> As <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> ſinned greatly, ſo he humbled himſelf greatly. Great Sins require great Flouds of Tears to waſh them away. I know forced Tears, out of the fear of Hell, can but little avail with God: they may conſiſt with love of Sin. There may be counterfeit Tears, which may be ſo far from pacifying God, that they will incenſe him the more, as knowing himſelf mocked by them. There may be ſo deep a ſenſe of Sin, as to ſtupefy: but where there is a kindly melting of the Heart for Sin, Tears will likely follow; and if they be in ſecret, they are likely ſincere. And if we weep bitterly for Sin, with S. <hi>Peter,</hi> we may expect a gracious Forgiveneſs, as S. <hi>Peter</hi> had: but if we grieve not for our Sins, we may expect God will make our Sins grievous againſt our will.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Tears and Sorrow for Sin muſt be as <hi>David</hi>'s weeping here, (Vocal,) with humble Supplication and earneſt Prayer for Pardon. When there is a ſpirit of Grace and Supplication joyned with Mourning, then is God ſought aright, and found by the Repenting perſon. Confeſſion and Sorrow for Sin is but to make way for Prayer, which is the chief thing whereby God is glorified, and the Sinner benefited. For then it is that his Heart turns to God, when it acknowledgeth its own Demerit, and God's Juſtice: and then God's Heart is turned to him; as it was to <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> when he and his people humbled themſelves, and ſaid, <hi>The Lord is Righteous,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 12.6. Which Preſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are effectuall, if</p>
               <p n="6">6. There be a Forſaking of Sin, and Obedience to
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:42122:31"/>God; as ſaith the Prophet, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.7. <hi>Let the wicked forſake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will abundantly par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</hi> Which <hi>David</hi> here obſerves, and therefore adds, verſ. 8. <hi>Depart from me, all ye workers of Iniquity; for the Lord hath heard the voice of my weeping:</hi> and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.115. <hi>Depart from me, ye Evil-doers; for I will keep the Commandments of my God. Surely,</hi> ſaith <hi>Elihu</hi> excellently, <hi>Job</hi> 34.31, 32. <hi>it is meet to be ſaid unto God, I have born Chaſtiſement, I will not offend any more. That which I ſee not, teach thou me: if I have done Iniquity, I will doe no more.</hi> Relapſes into Sin make mens caſes the worſe, ſo as that <hi>their latter end is worſe then their beginning,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.20. The Devil enters into ſuch with more force; hardens his Heart the more, who hath ſeemed to repent, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes himſelf again <hi>like the Dog to his vomit, or the Sow that was waſhed to her wallowing in the mire;</hi> procures more Vengeance from God, who <hi>walks contrary to them that walk contrary to him,</hi> and when men are <hi>not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed</hi> by Afflictions, <hi>puniſheth them ſeven times more for their Sins,</hi> Levit. 26.23, 24. And therefore <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Warning to the cured perſon is neceſſary for all that are holpen in their Affliction, <hi>Sin no more, leſt a worſe thing happen to thee:</hi> and <hi>John Baptiſt</hi>'s Advice is to be followed by all Penitents, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.8. <hi>Bring forth therefore fruits meet for Repentance.</hi>

I preſume none of you are ſo miſs-led by any ſpirit of Errour, that you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive your ſelves perfect and without Sin: I fear too many of you are guilty of great Tranſgreſſions; I wiſh you were none of you ſuch as ſin preſumptuouſly, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Light of your Conſciences, oppoſe the Truth, oppreſs the Poor, delight your Bodies, misſpend your Time, miſimploy your Eſtates and Abilities, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps glory in your Profaneneſs, Swearing, Drinking, Cheating, Lying, Backſliding, Falſe accuſing, rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Jars and Contentions. If any of you be guilty of any of theſe Sins, or have had experience of God's Hand in his Afflicting of him, or is ſenſible of his Morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; let him bethink himſelf how his Afflictions work on him, whether they bring his Sin to Remembrance; whether the Remembrance of his Sin be more grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous then his Sufferings; whether he complain of it, rather then his Affliction: let him ſearch his waies, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs his Sins at leaſt to God, weep and groan, as <hi>David,</hi> with real <hi>Sorrow according to God,</hi> which may <hi>cauſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance not to be repented of;</hi> ſeek the Face of God with Supplication, and amend his waies. Hath not God rather cauſe to ſay of you as he did of the <hi>Jews, Jer.</hi> 8.6, 7. <hi>I hearkened and heard, but they ſpake not aright: no man repented him of his Wickedneſs, ſaying, What have I done? every one turned to his courſe, as the horſe ruſheth into the battel. Yea, the Stork in the heaven knoweth his appointed time, and the Turtle and the Crane and the Swallow obſerve the time of their coming: but my
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:42122:32"/>people know not the Judgment of their God.</hi> Will he not, when he obſerves your doings, find you rather Ranting in a Tavern, then Praying in the Church? rather Sporting in your Beds, then Watering them with Tears? Cheating one another in Gaming, rather then Relieving the Poor? Deviſing rather Miſchief on your Beds, then Weeping for your unmercifull and unrighteous dealings in your Cloſets? regarding Paſs-times more then holy Sermons? reading in your Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers rather wanton Comedies, or light Poems, then the Bible and Holy Writings?</p>
               <p>Yea, let me ask the devouteſt of you, whether at any time you do weep for your Sins of daily incurſion. Are you ſenſible of your too much Formality, too little Fervency in your Prayers? Do you weep for your vain Thoughts, proud Imaginations, inordinate Deſires, your Ignorance, Forgetfulneſs of many Duties, Sloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, Paſſionateneſs, Omiſſions of many Duties you ſhould doe, Uncharitableneſs, Unthankfulneſs, and many other Sins of Errour and ſecret Sins, which God knows, though men do not? Sure a ſincere Chriſtian is a weeping Chriſtian: if God keep him from greater Enormities, yet he will find cauſe enough to mourn for his daily Aberrations; if he do (as a true Penitent doth) take notice of the Naughtineſs of his own deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Heart. If you ſay daily the Lord's Prayer, and be not ſenſible of your daily Sins, do you not mock God, when you ſay, <hi>Forgive us our Sins?</hi> Sure <hi>Chriſt,</hi> when he directed the uſe of that Prayer, appointed you to be examining and judging your ſelves every day, to confeſs your Sins, to bemoan them, to ask Pardon for them, to reſolve and vow againſt them every day. And, Oh that God would give you a Heart of Fleſh, in ſtead of a Heart of Stone, you that are guilty of more hainous Crimes, ſuch as I have named, or any other your own
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:42122:32"/>Conſciences can inform you of; to imitate S. <hi>Peter,</hi> to <hi>goe out</hi> immediately after this Sermon is ended, <hi>and weep bitterly;</hi> to <hi>break off your Sins by Righteouſneſs,</hi> as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi> adviſed <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> Dan. 4.27.</p>
               <p>And you that (though unblamable towards Men, yet) are conſcious of offending God by any privy Tranſgreſſions, yea all of you who have any remainders of ſinfull Corruption in you, Oh that you would not defer, but this day, yea every day, imitate holy <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> in his holy vocall penitential Weeping, which hath been this day deſcribed to you: And let every Affliction you feel or fear, ſpecially the thought of your Death, bring you to a daily practice of Repentance, and Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication unto God, that your Iniquities may not be your Ruine; but that your Tranquillity may be length<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned here, and you may be bleſſed for ever in the world to come. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                  <p>Have mercy upon me, O God, according to thy Loving-kindneſs: according to the multitude of thy tender Mercies, blot out my Tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</p>

            <p>WE find in this Text a Sinner ſtruck with the ſenſe of his Sins, and pleading at the Mercy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeat of God for the Remiſſion and Forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of them. If the Greatneſs of his Perſon, or the Sacredneſs of his Function, had been Antidote enough againſt Temptation, Armour of proof againſt the <hi>fiery darts of Satan,</hi> we had not this day heard of <hi>David</hi> a Sinner; for he was a King, and he was a Prophet, and <hi>a man after God's own heart.</hi> But ſince neither his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion nor his Royalty could protect him from being a Sinner, and that in ſo foul and crimſon Crimes as Adultery and Murther, (which occaſioned the penning of this Pſalm;) 'tis happy that we yet find him here a Penitent, and a complaining one: for we have him
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:42122:34"/>here a Supplicant at his Prayers on his knees, with a <hi>Miſerere mei, Deus, Have mercy on me, O God,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>What S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid of himſelf, that his Fall and Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very was a Pattern to all that ſhould believe in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> may be as rightly ſaid of <hi>David;</hi> The Lord permitted him to ſin, that no man might preſume, but the ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt Saint might take heed leſt he fall; that none might be <hi>high-minded, but fear:</hi> and the Lord alſo recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him by Repentance, and hath left his Confeſſion and Abſolution upon record, that none might deſpair; but that his Example might direct them to return to God after their Wandrings, and erect and keep up their ſpirits from ſinking, by the aſſurance of his Mercy, ſo remarkably vouchſafed to ſo great a Tranſgreſſour.</p>
            <p>And therefore if there be any Soul, that hears me this day, ſtruck with a deep ſenſe and horrour of his Sins, lying groaning and trembling under the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy preſſure and burthen of them, let him not deſpair of Pardon, either by reaſon of the Quality or Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of them: for here are <hi>Loving-kindneſſes,</hi> or kind Mercies, a <hi>Multitude of tender Mercies;</hi> well expreſſed by <hi>Zachary,</hi> Luk. 1.78. the <hi>Bowells of Compaſſion of our God;</hi> ſuch as are in a Woman, or rather exceeding <hi>the Compaſſion of a Woman on the Son of her womb,</hi> Iſa. 49.15. Loving-kindneſs of God, againſt Unkindneſs of Man; Bowells of Mercy towards him who had no Compaſſion on himſelf; mercifull Remembrance of him who forgat his God and himſelf; awakening and ſaving him, who in his inſenſible Lethargy of Impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence would have deſtroyed himſelf. Whoever thou art, know that the Holy Ghoſt hath recorded this Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for thy Conſolation: not onely ſet <hi>David</hi>'s Fall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thee; but likewiſe the means of his Recovery, the many and tender Mercies of his God. As the Prophet <hi>Nathan</hi> was ſent to <hi>David,</hi> ſo <hi>David</hi> himſelf
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:42122:34"/>is ſent to thee. He extends and reaches out to thee the ſame Phyſick that he took himſelf. And therefore diſtruſt not thy Cure; but come and hear <hi>David</hi> bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly bewailing his Condition, and with him bewail ſadly thine own: See him weeping, and weep thou as faſt: Hear his Voice and Cry piercing the Clouds; and be not thou dumb, but as loud as he, till thou haſt awakened the Compaſſion of thy God. Obſerve all this, and ſay with him, <hi>Have mercy upon me, O God,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Which words are the main Petition of this Holy Supplicant in behalf of himſelf, for pardoning Grace, out of the deep ſenſe of his great Sins, and apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of God's great Mercies. And they exhibit to us,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>David</hi>'s Malady, the Diſeaſe which pained him to the heart, which made him groan, cry out, and be inſtant with the great Phyſician of Souls for Cure: which is expreſſed with Aggravation in three words. 1. <hi>Tranſgreſſion;</hi> a word that notes ſometimes Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion or Revolt from God. 2. <hi>Iniquity</hi> or Perverſeneſs; importing his Unrighteouſneſs to <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah,</hi> his Wife, Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, his Child by her, his whole Houſe and People, who all taſted of the bitterneſs of his eating that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden fruit. 3. <hi>Sin</hi> or <hi>Errour;</hi> intimating the great Folly which he now deprehended, in yielding ſo to his Luſt, as to erre from God's Command, and for a little Pleaſure, to draw on himſelf the Wrath of God, and the Horrour of Conſcience now upon him. He uſeth not mincing or diminutive terms, as thoſe that love their Sins as fond Parents do their Children, and call their Monſtroſities ſmall Blemiſhes: but paints out his Sins in their moſt ugly Deformity, to ſhew his Hatred of them to the utmoſt, and to juſtifie God fully. Yea he uſeth thoſe very terms to expreſs his Sins by, which God himſelf uſed in his moſt bleſſed Declaration of
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:42122:35"/>himſelf, when he proclaimed of himſelf, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.6, 7. <hi>The Lord, the Lord God, mercifull and gracious, long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuffering, and abundant in Goodneſs and Truth, keeping Mercy for thouſands, forgiving Iniquity, Tranſgreſſion, and Sin.</hi> To which it is very likely he had an eye, and that he made that Proclamation the riſe of his Hope, That though his Sins were great, yet they were not any other then God had proclaimed of old, he did forgive; and after in his New Covenant he more fully aſſured the Condonation of them: <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.34. <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.12.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The thing <hi>David</hi> requeſteth of God: and that is full Remiſſion, expreſſed in three terms.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. Of <hi>Blotting out his Tranſgreſſions;</hi> a phraſe uſed by the Prophet <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43.25. and 44.22. And it inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates, that his Sins were written by God in his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, as in a Book of Records: in the ſenſe that <hi>Job</hi> ſaid, 13.26. and 14.17. God did <hi>write bitter things againſt him,</hi> and <hi>ſealed up his Iniquity.</hi> And the blotting it out, is the putting it out of his <hi>Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance,</hi> ſo as not to charge it upon him, nor condemn him for it: as it is explained <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43.25.</item>
               <item>2. Of <hi>Waſhing him throughly from his Iniquity;</hi> a term noting frequent or abundant waſhing: that is, Abſolution, meant by <hi>Ablution,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.11. where it comprehends <hi>Juſtification</hi> as well as <hi>Sanctification.</hi> And ſo it is ſaid, <hi>Revel.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath <hi>waſhed us from our Sins in his own bloud;</hi> alluding, 'tis likely, to the cleanſing of men from their Leproſy and other Legall Pollutions in the <hi>Moſaicall</hi> Law.</item>
               <item>3. The third term is, <hi>Cleanſe me from my Sin;</hi> by Emundation meaning Emendation, purifying his Heart from the love of his Sin, and his Life from the practice of it any more: as it is expreſſed <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.16, 17. <hi>Waſh ye, make you clean, put away the evil of your doings from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mine eyes, ceaſe to doe evil, learn to doe well.</hi>

            </list>
            <pb n="61" facs="tcp:42122:35"/>
            <p n="3">3. The Third thing conſiderable in <hi>David</hi>'s Petition (which is indeed the Hindge on which all turns) is, the <hi>Loving-kindneſs</hi> or Benignity of God, <hi>the Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of his tender Mercies;</hi> ſuch as are in the Womb or Bowells of a tender Mother towards her Child. And this <hi>Loving-kindneſs</hi> and <hi>Multitude of tender Mercies</hi> is urged by <hi>David</hi> as the Motive, the impulſive Cauſe, or ſole Reaſon of granting his Requeſt; of <hi>blotting out his Tranſgreſſions, waſhing him throughly from his Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> and <hi>cleanſing him from his Sin.</hi> In the ſame manner as <hi>Moſes</hi> pleaded with God for <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Num. 14.17, 18, 19. after whoſe Copy this Petition ſeems to be fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and is an exact Pattern according to which a Penitent Supplicant is to addreſs himſelf to God for Eaſe from under the preſſure of his Sins; teaching us theſe Points.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. <hi>That the Remembrance of his Sin is the greateſt Grievance to a Penitent Sinner. David</hi> complains not of other Evils incident to him and his, but his own Sin.</item>
               <item>2. <hi>That a Penitent Sinner doth not mince or leſſen his Sin, but ſetteth it out or confeſſeth it to God in its greateſt Aggravations, in variety of odious Appellations, when he betakes himſelf to God for Redreſs.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>3. <hi>That the Blotting out of our Tranſgreſſions, the Waſhing throughly from our Iniquity, the cleanſing from our Sin, is to be ſought from God.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>4. <hi>That we are to beg earneſtly, not onely for Blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out our Tranſgreſſions, but alſo for through Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing and Cleanſing from Iniquity and Sin, not onely by Condonation of them, but alſo by Emendation and Amendment of life.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>5. <hi>That it is Loving-kindneſs and multitude of tender Mercies which is the Motive whereupon God blotteth out Tranſgreſſions, waſheth throughly the guilty
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:42122:36"/>Sinner from Iniquity, and cleanſeth him from his Sin.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>6. <hi>That the onely way to obtain theſe things is, to beg them of God upon this conſideration, and no other.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>You ſee a large field and copious matter is before us, in which I might exſpatiate far, and proſecute a long time: but I will endeavour to abbreviate, and end with the time.</p>

                  <hi>That the Remembrance of his Sin is the greateſt Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance to a Penitent Sinner.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is evident from their penitential Complaints. In the many mournfull Elegies of <hi>David,</hi> the great Preſſure of his ſpirit lay in the Remembrance of his Sin. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 38.3, 4, 5. <hi>There is no reſt in my bones, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of my Sin. For mine Iniquities are gone over my head; as an heavy burthen, they are too heavy for me. My Wounds ſtink and are corrupt, becauſe of my Fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> And again, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40.12. <hi>Innumerable Evils have compaſſed me about, mine Iniquities have taken hold upon me, ſo that I am not able to look up; they are more then the hairs of my head, therefore my heart faileth me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is true, Afflictions are hard to be born: Poverty, and Diſgrace, and Impriſonment, and Pains of body, are very heavy upon many perſons; Diſcontents, and Fears of trouble, Griefs and Sorrows for loſs of Friends, Wife, Children, do often quench mens ſpirits, and ſink them into the Grave. Nor is it to be denied, but that many times they cauſe men to prefer <hi>death before life,</hi> and to <hi>chuſe ſtrangling</hi> before breathing, <hi>Job</hi> 7.15. But upon the ſenſe of Sin, when the Conſcience feels the weight of it, when God ſhoots his Arrows into a man, and <hi>haeret lateri lethalis Arundo,</hi> the deadly Arrow
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:42122:36"/>ſticks in his ſide; then the Venome thereof drinks up his ſpirit, is as the ſtinging of a Scorpion or fiery flying Serpent, it tortures like Hell, and is more bitter and terrible then Death it ſelf. <hi>The ſpirit of a man will ſuſtain his infirmity;</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon,</hi> Prov. 18.14.) <hi>but a wounded ſpirit who can bear?</hi> In other Afflictions there is ſome Remedy, from Reaſon or Faith, if not to comfort, yet to quiet the Soul: but in the ſenſe of Sin committed (till Pardon thereof be appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended) no Argument can be faſtned, but will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected. Men in theſe Wounds of Conſcience doe like perſons in extreme Anguiſh, who tear off their Plaiſters that ſhould eaſe or cure them: ſo do wounded Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences reject all Allegations of Scripture, brought to allay their Anguiſh, as if they belong'd not to them; as <hi>Spira</hi> and others have done. And that which is the Sting of Sin, that moſt of all makes it deadly poiſonous, is the apprehenſion of God as angry, as an Enemy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appeaſable, (till it be acknowledged to be what it is, <hi>an evil and bitter thing that we have ſinned againſt the Lord, and that his fear is not in us;</hi> as the Prophet ſpeaks, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.19.) Which leads me to the</p>
            </div>
            <div type="observation">
               <head>II. OBSERVATION.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>That a Penitent Sinner doth not mince or leſſen his Sin, but ſets it out or confeſſeth it to God in its greateſt Aggravations, in variety of odious Appellations, when he betakes himſelf to God for Redreſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So <hi>David,</hi> beſides the variety of terms he here paints out the Deformity of his Sins by, adds alſo verſ. 3, 4. <hi>I acknowledge my Tranſgreſſions, and my Sin is ever before me. Againſt thee, thee onely, have I ſinned, and done this Evil in thy ſight.</hi> And to ſet out his Sin as the more venomous, he derives it from his originall innate
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:42122:37"/>Pravity: <hi>Behold, I was ſhapen in Iniquity, and in Sin did my mother conceive me,</hi> verſ. 5. And S. <hi>Paul</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged himſelf <hi>the chiefeſt of Sinners,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.15. The Reaſons hereof are,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe otherwiſe the Heart loves and favours the Sin, and the Repentance and Humiliation will appear to be but feigned. True Hatred of Sin will cauſe us to confeſs and abandon it with all our might. <hi>Odium eſt Appetitus amovendi:</hi> it will ſtir up a deſire to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move it, it will cauſe <hi>Deteſtation, Clearing, Revenge, Indignation, Zeal, Fear;</hi> as it is ſaid of the <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.11. The poor Publican durſt not <hi>lift up his eyes to heaven, but ſmote on his breaſt, ſaying, God be mercifull to me a Sinner,</hi> Luk. 18.13.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By this means he juſtifies God in his Sentence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Sin, in his Puniſhment; acknowledgeth his own Deſert: which is the Reaſon here, <hi>That thou mighteſt be juſtified when thou ſpeakeſt, and be clear when thou judgeſt,</hi> verſ. 4. The more we aggravate our Sins, the more we magnify the Juſtice of God's Law, and his dealing with us.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It alſo tends to the magnifying of God's Grace in Pardoning; that <hi>where Sin abounds, there Grace over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abounds,</hi> Rom. 5.20. It is rich Grace that forgives great and many Sins. They that make their Sins veni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, and ſpeak of them as ſmall matters, do ſhew they take themſelves little beholden to God to pardon them, and that they owe little thanks for it. To whom <hi>much is forgiven, he loveth much; to whom little is forgiven, the ſame loveth little,</hi> Luk. 7.47.</p>
               <p n="4">4. This is the way to obtain Pardon. <hi>He that hideth his Sins ſhall not proſper: but he that confeſſeth and forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth them ſhall have mercy,</hi> Prov. 28.13. <hi>Stultorum in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curata Pudor malus <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcera celat.</hi> They are fooliſh per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, that when they are to make uſe of a Phyſician,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:42122:37"/>conceal their Diſeaſe, and tell not the worſt of it: for thereby they diſable the Phyſicran from Curing them, and are Authours of their own death. But a wiſe Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient will relate all the Symptoms of his Diſeaſe, and declare the worſt of it; that ſo there may be a through, and not a palliated Cure. So it is with a true Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, he declares his Sin to God with the greateſt Shame to himſelf, in all its evil Circumſtances, that he may diſpoſe God to forgive him: it being God's way, to juſtify them that condemn themſelves; as the poor Publican, that with a dejected heart and look craved <hi>mercy to him a Sinner.</hi> Which brings us to the</p>

               <p>This was the courſe which <hi>David</hi> took, and <hi>Manaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeh,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 33.12, 13. <hi>When he was in Affliction, he beſought the Lord his God, and humbled himſelf great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly before the God of his Fathers, and prayed unto him: and he was intreated of him, and heard his Supplication.</hi> No ſuch Prayer to be found in Scripture, as is in the Office of the <hi>Romaniſts, (Mary, Mother of Grace, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Mercy, defend us from the Enemy, grant Pardon to the guilty.) Chriſt</hi> directs us to ſay, <hi>Our Father, which art in Heaven, forgive us our Treſpaſſes.</hi> And good Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: for, 1. Our Sins are againſt him, and therefore are to be pardoned by him. <hi>Againſt thee have I ſinned,</hi> ſaith <hi>David;</hi> therefore do thou <hi>blot out my Tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</hi> He muſt cancel the Bond, who is the Creditor. <hi>I will ſay to my Father,</hi> ſaith the Prodigall ſon, <hi>Father, I have ſinned againſt Heaven, and againſt thee, and am no more worthy to be called thy Son.</hi> 2. It is he onely that
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:42122:38"/>hath power to forgive Sins. <hi>Who can forgive Sins but God onely?</hi> Mark 2.7. <hi>Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? not one,</hi> Job 14.4. It is God's Prerogative, which he challengeth, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43.25. <hi>I, even I am he that blotteth out thy Tranſgreſſions for mine own ſake, and will not remember thy Sins.</hi> It is true, <hi>the Son of man had power on earth to forgive Sins;</hi> but he was alſo the Son of God. It is true, the Apoſtles had power to remit Sins by a peculiar delegation from <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or (as the Apoſtle S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks) <hi>in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Chriſt,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.10. Nor is it to be denied, that Miniſters of the Goſpel, miniſterially, by preaching the Goſpell, may be ſaid to forgive Sins declaratively, and inſtrumentally, by bringing men to Repentance and Faith, on which Forgiveneſs and Cleanſing from Sin follow: but not as the Pope pretends to forgive Sins, by his Indulgences, authoritatively; or as the Popiſh Prieſts, by their Abſolution, certainly and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately. Men may forgive Sins, by the aſſuring of Pardon to the truly Penitent and Believing. And the Abſolution of the Miniſter is of great moment to quiet the guilty Conſcience, if he doe it <hi>(Clave non errante;)</hi> when he is skilfull in Binding and loſing, and the Penitent freely confeſſeth, and ſincerely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and unfeignedly purpoſeth to amend; without which the Abſolution is invalid.

As the Guilt of Sin is to be pardoned, and the Stain of Sin to be waſhed away: ſo is the <hi>Conſcience</hi> to be <hi>purged from dead works,</hi> that we may <hi>ſerve the living God;</hi> the <hi>Heart is to be ſprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kled from an evil Conſcience, and the Body to be waſhed with pure water;</hi> as the expreſſions are <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.14. and 10.22. alluſively to the Legall Purifying with bloud and water, to which anſwers the <hi>waſhing of Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and renewing of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> Tit. 3.5. which is thus expreſſed by S. <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 6.4. <hi>Therefore we are buried with him by Baptiſm into death, that like as Chriſt was raiſed up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even ſo we alſo ſhould walk in newneſs of life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this is a principal part of true Repentance, to have a renewed Heart, and to lead a new Life. And therefore S. <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> when the multitude came to him to be baptized of him for the Remiſſion of Sins, chargeth them to <hi>bring forth Fruits meet for Repentance, Luk.</hi> 3.7, 8. letting them to underſtand, that <hi>every Tree which bringeth not forth good Fruit, is hewn down, and caſt into the fire.</hi> And our Saviour, when he found the impotent man, who was healed by him at the Pool of <hi>Betheſda,</hi> told him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.14. <hi>Behold, thou art made whole: ſin no more, leſt a worſe thing come unto thee.</hi> For, as <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaith, if after <hi>the unclean Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is gone out of a man,</hi> he <hi>return again,</hi> and <hi>findeth the houſe empty, ſwept and garniſhed;</hi> that is, after the Sinner in ſome ſort hath repented, and his Conſcience hath been quieted, and his former Courſes relinqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed for a time, he grow ſecure and looſe in his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation; the unclean Spirit <hi>taketh with him ſeven
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:42122:39"/>other Spirits more wicked then himſelf, and they enter in and dwell there: and the laſt ſtate of that man is worſe then the firſt,</hi> Matth. 12.43, 44, 45. Satan doth make ſuch a perſon more ſinfull then before, and his Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is worſe then it was before his ſeeming Repentance. Moſt truly doth S. <hi>Peter</hi> tell us, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.20, 21, 22. <hi>If after perſons have eſcaped the pollutions of the world, through the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, they are again intangled therein, and overcome; the latter end is worſe then the beginning. For it had been better for them not to have known the way of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, then after they have known it, to turn from the holy Commandment delivered unto them. But it happens to them according to the true Proverb, The Dog is retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to his own vomit again, and the Sow that was waſhed, to her wallowing in the mire.</hi> As it is with men who relapſe into a Fever which was for a time abated, their Diſeaſe grows worſe and mortal: ſo is it with them that after ſome imperfect Change and Peace ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, do fall back into the ſame or other Sins, become ſecure and heedleſs of Temptations; they commonly become more notorious Sinners, and more hardned therein to their perdition. None likely make a mock of Sin, and ſport themſelves in Evil, more then they who once ſeemed to be humbled, penitent, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed. And therefore there is as great a neceſſity of begging for effectuall Renovation, as Condona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, from God; Sanctification throughout, in Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, Soul and Spirit, as well as Juſtification from all our Tranſgreſſions.

               <p>And indeed all that is done by us, before God pardons and cleanſeth us from Sin, provokes God againſt us: nor is there ſo much as a thought in us of returning to God, after our departure from his waies; nor any help in our ſelves to deliver our own Souls, till he pities us and ſaves us. <hi>O Iſrael,</hi> (ſaith God, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 13.9.) <hi>thou haſt deſtroyed thy ſelf; but in me is thine help.</hi> He <hi>blotteth out our Tranſgreſſions for his own Name's ſake,</hi> and out of his abundant Mercy through <hi>Chriſt.</hi>

                  <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath told us, he is <hi>the Way, the Truth, and the Life;</hi> and that <hi>no man cometh to the Father but by him, Joh.</hi> 14.6.

               <p>He doth not as <hi>Eve</hi> did, father it on the Serpent; or as <hi>Adam,</hi> on <hi>Eve;</hi> but imputes the acting of it to

               <p>Impenitent Sinners charge their Wickedneſs on their ill Fortune, unhappy Deſtiny, unlucky Planet: which is done with the like reaſon as if the Knife were to be blamed for a man's Self-murther; or the Bread he eats, as the cauſe that he is choaked; or the Girdle he wears, that he was ſtrangled by it. Planets and other natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Agents, though they have Influence on the Body, which may provoke to Evil, yet they cannot neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitate the Mind to aſſent to it, or to act accordingly. Caſual Concurrence of things may prompt, but not compell to Sin. Evil Company, bad Counſel, cruel Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants, may have power on the Members, not the Will. It is true, the Devil is the Father of Lies; <hi>He that commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth Sin is of the Devil:</hi> but were it not that man's Heart did entertain his Motions, embrace his Sugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions, Sin could not be engendred by them.

               <p>This is manifeſt by all the Examples of humble Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitents in the Scripture. <hi>We have ſinned,</hi> ſaith holy <hi>Daniel,</hi> Dan. 9.5. <hi>and have committed Iniquity, and have done wickedly, and have rebelled, even by depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting from thy Precepts and from thy Judgments.</hi> And holy <hi>Ezra,</hi> (9.6.) <hi>O my God, I am aſhamed and bluſh to lift up my face to thee, my God: for our Iniquities are increaſed over our heads, and our Treſpaſs is grown up unto the Heavens.</hi> Thus when the juſtified Publican prays, he <hi>dares not lift up his eyes to Heaven, but ſmites on his breaſt, ſaying, God be mercifull to me a Sinner.</hi> And S. <hi>Paul</hi> cenſures himſelf as <hi>the chief of Sinners,</hi> for thoſe Sins he committed in Ignorance and Unbelief. He knows that God ſees more evil in his Sins then he himſelf can diſcern; that Sins are not to be cenſured according to mens eſtimation, but God's moſt pure Law and righteous Judgment; that God is of <hi>purer eyes then to behold Evil,</hi> and that he <hi>cannot look on Iniquity</hi> with the leaſt approbation or connivence; that what is highly prized in mens eyes, or made a venial Sin by men, is counted a foul Abomination
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:42122:44"/>with God; that the leaſt Sin is againſt an Infinite Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, and coſt no leſs then the Bloud of the Son of God to expiate it; that there is no Venial Sin in its own nature, to <hi>ſay, Raca, Thou fool, to our Brother, makes a man liable to Hell-fire;</hi> that every Sin is of the Devil, who ſinned from the beginning; that <hi>the wages of Sin,</hi> every Sin, <hi>is Death,</hi> even that Death which is oppoſite to everlaſting Life.</p>
               <p>Hence it is that <hi>David</hi> makes not a ſmall matter of <hi>the Sins of his youth,</hi> but prays God <hi>not to remember them:</hi> and <hi>Job</hi> complaineth, that God <hi>wrote bitter things againſt him, and made him to poſſeſs the Sins of his youth.</hi> And <hi>Chriſt</hi> makes <hi>idle words</hi> ſuch, as that for them men are to be <hi>accountable at the day of Judgment.</hi> Popiſh Doctrine of Venial Sins, Reſolutions of Caſes of Conſcience after Popiſh Caſuiſts Dictates, are not found in the expreſſions of Scripture-Penitents; much leſs Phariſaicall Vauntings of Self-righteouſneſs, or Monkiſh Oſtentation of their own Merits, or Quakers Opinions of Innocency and Perfection: but Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of their Tranſgreſſions and Sins, with the hainous Degree and Circumſtances of them.

               </p>
               <p>There is indeed a ſetting our Iniquities before our faces which is pernicious; when we look upon our Sins as of ſo horrid a Guilt that they are unpardonable: as when <hi>Cain</hi> told God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.13. <hi>My Puniſhment is greater then I can bear;</hi> or, <hi>Mine Iniquity is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then that it may be forgiven.</hi> So indeed it falls

               <p>Such a View of Sin, as thus tends to Deſpair, that eyes onely God's Juſtice and their own Deſert, that begets Hatred of God as a Tyrant, no Addreſs to him as a Gracious Prince, is indeed very dangerous.</p>
               <p>Humble Penitents do not ſo ſet their Iniquities be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them: This is the manner onely of deſpairing <hi>Saul's,</hi> revolting <hi>Spira's,</hi> ſuch as have ſinned wilfully with an high hand, and continue in their Apoſtaſie from the Truth; that ſay, <hi>There is no hope: we have loved ſtrangers, and after them will we go,</hi> Jer. 2.25.

                  <hi>The true Penitent tells God of ſetting his Iniquities before him, to induce God to relenting Compaſſion towards him, and gracious Condonation of him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the Penitentiall Pſalm <hi>De profundis,</hi> (130.2, 3, 4.) the Penitent Sinner thus beſpeaks God; <hi>Let thine ears be attentive to the voice of my Supplication. If thou, Lord, ſhouldſt mark Iniquities, O Lord, who ſhall ſtand? But there is Forgiveneſs with thee, that thou mayeſt be feared.</hi> Even the wicked <hi>Ninevites</hi> had ſo much apprehenſion of the poſſibility of God's mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull Clemency, that (after <hi>Jonas</hi>'s Proclamation of their approaching Ruine) they reſolved to cry migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily to God upon this apprehenſion, <hi>Who can tell if God will turn and repent, and turn away from his fierce Anger, that we periſh not?</hi> Jon. 3.9.</p>
               <p>'Tis true, they that worſhip the Devil, and pray to him, doe all out of Fear, as looking for nothing but Cruelty from unclean Spirits: But <hi>Jonas</hi> in his fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward fit, Chap. 4.2. acknowledgeth that the Lord is <hi>a gracious God, and mercifull, ſlow to Anger, and of great Kindneſs, and repenteth him of the Evil.</hi> Even by the experience of them that know not God, this is found true: which made even Infidels cry unto the Lord in their Diſtreſſes, and confeſs their Sins in hope of Help. The believing Penitent knows both by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, and from the Nature, Works and Word of God, that when he ſets his Sins before him, God caſts them behind his back: that God <hi>looks upon men, and if any ſay, I have ſinned, and perverted that which was right, and it profited me not; He will deliver his Soul from the Pit, and his Life ſhall ſee the Light,</hi> Job 33.27, 28. They have learned, that <hi>he that hideth his

That, <hi>if we confeſs our Sins, he is faithfull and juſt to forgive us our Sins: and the Bloud of Jeſus Chriſt, his Son, cleanſeth us from all Sin,</hi> 1 Joh. 1.7, 9. They judge, that what <hi>David</hi> found they ſhall find: <hi>I ſaid, I will confeſs my Tranſgreſſions to the Lord; and thou forgaveſt the Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of my Sin.</hi> And therefore, <hi>For this ſhall every one that is Godly pray unto thee in a time that thou maiſt be found,</hi> Pſal. 32.5, 6. And conſequently, it is their courſe, (as being beſt for them) to ſet their Sins be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, ſo as to humble them; and to ſet them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, that he may pardon them.</p>

               <p>And now, I beſeech you, lay all that I have ſaid to heart, as of greateſt concernment to each of you. What <hi>David</hi> did, what all the Saints have done in all Ages, you ſhould doe in this; their Practice ſhould be your Pattern: It is neceſſary to be done, though it be much againſt the ſpirits of men.</p>
               <p>Moſt men are quick-ſighted in viewing the Faults of others, but blear-eyed when they are to look upon their own Crimes: Cenſuring and Judging others is very frequent; Self-judging is very rare. They that would <hi>take a Mote out of their Brother's eye,</hi> will not <hi>take notice of the Beam in their own.</hi> Few are willing to have their Sins ſet before them by others; and themſelves are far from ſetting them before them of their own accord. A free Reprover is accounted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable. Men hate them that rebuke them. Yea, a Miniſter, who by Office is bound to doe it, though he doe it to ſave their and his own Soul, yet he is not endured for it, but declined and perſecuted. They
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:42122:47"/>that cannot deny their Sins, yet put off the Faultineſs of them to ſome other Cauſe. They that acknowledge their Sins to have been from themſelves, yet excuſe and extenuate them. Scarce a man confeſſeth his Sins that are hidden from men: if he do confeſs them to God, it is but ſlightly. <hi>What a Beaſt was I?</hi> ſaith the Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard; <hi>God forgive me,</hi> ſaith the Swearer: though the one wallows in his Intemperance day after day, and the other profanes the Name of God every hour.</p>
               <p>Thus Sin is ſlightly acknowledged by the Sinner, without any ſenſe of the Iniquity of his Nature, or the Love he hath to his Sin, which are the Cauſes of it; without any Compunction of heart, without Remorſe of Soul, without Bemoaning it to God, in Supplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, bewailing his Folly, his Naughtineſs, and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly, humbly begging Pardon.</p>
               <p>Yea, when God ſets mens Sins (by his Judgments on them) in order before them, they will not ſet them before themſelves, to give him the Glory of his Juſtice: when <hi>his Hand is lifted up, they will not ſee:</hi> when he makes their Hearts ake, their Eyes weep, by his Strokes for their Sins, they fret with Anger, but weep not out of Sorrow for Sin.</p>
               <p>No marvel that men find not the Comfort of God's pardoning Grace, when they ſlubber over this great Buſineſs (which the Godly have always found to be the right and onely way to Mercy) in ſo dull and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent a manner, as if they could deal with God as with an Idol, that hath neither eyes to ſee their Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitency, nor hands to puniſh their Sins: and ſo carry themſelves as if they could mock God with a few words of courſe, without any ſerious or hearty Sorrow for their Diſobedience to God's Law, and Provocation of his terrible Majeſty.</p>
               <p>Oh that you would in time repent throughly of this
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:42122:48"/>your want of Repentance, or the perfunctory doing of it. And that you would bethink your ſelves, that you may deceive your ſelves, but cannot deceive God: that your Dallying with God will end in your Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation: that you will never have Peace with him, till you ſhew that you count and uſe your Sins as his and your Enemies.</p>
               <p>Doe this then which <hi>David</hi> ſaith he did, Search out your Sins impartially, know them to be your own Brats; that the leaſt of them are of a Viperous brood; that they will bring upon you everlaſting Puniſhment, without much Repentance and real Amendment.</p>
               <p>Set your Sins before you in their ugly ſhape: Set God before you as a ſevere Judge, and yet withall a mercifull Prince: Confeſs them to God with godly Sorrow: Supplicate for Pardon with humbled Souls: Sprinkle your Conſciences with the Bloud of <hi>Chriſt</hi> by the hand of Faith: and Reſolve to leave your Wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derings, and to follow <hi>Chriſt.</hi> And then, and not till then, you ſhall have Peace with God: which he grant for his Son's ſake, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Amen.</p>

            <p>Whence it came to paſs, that as in his Afflictions he made many Pſalms of Exultation in God, and Exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Name, ſo as to gain the Elogy of the <hi>ſweet Singer of Iſrael;</hi> ſo by reaſon of his great Fall in defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling <hi>Bathſheba,</hi> he is fain to mourn as a Dove, to change his tune, to ſing Lamentation, to bewail his Tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and to cry <hi>Peccavi</hi> in this Penitential Pſalm, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed (as the Title ſhews) by reaſon of his Fall into thoſe horrid Evils of Adultery and Murther. For ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piating of which, though the Law yielded no Sacrifice, yet the Grace of God he knew did: and therefore he prays inſtantly, both for Pardon of what he had done, and for preventing Grace againſt future Relapſes, as the words of my Text import; <hi>Caſt me not away from thy Preſence, and take not thy Holy Spirit,</hi> or <hi>Spirit of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, from me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In which words he deprecates two Evils as moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious: 1. The Ejection out of God's Preſence; 2. The Loſs of his Holy Spirit.</p>
            <p>Concerning theſe, it may be enquired, how he could pray againſt that which elſewhere he ſeems to reckon as not fecible, when he ſaith, <hi>Whither ſhall I goe from thy Spirit? or whither ſhall I flee from thy Preſence?</hi> Pſal. 139.7. which intimates as if there were no eſcaping God's Spirit, or avoiding God's Preſence: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was in vain for him to petition God againſt that which could not be effected, though God ſhould goe about it.</p>
            <pb n="89" facs="tcp:42122:49"/>
            <p>To which I anſwer, That it is true, that God's enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative Preſence is every-where, and therefore there could not be a Caſting him out of it, nor could he goe any whither where he might hide himſelf, or not have the Spirit of God to find him out, and to reach him: his Omnipreſence, Omniſcience and Omnipotency make ſuch an Excluſion or Subtraction unimaginable.</p>
            <p>But there is a Preſence of Favour, of Aſſiſtence, of Protection, an having of the Spirit for Guidance, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and Ability for operation, (here meant,) which a perſon may be excluded from, and deſtitute of: ſuch as <hi>Cain</hi> dreaded, when he ſaid, <hi>My Puniſhment is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then I can bear. Behold, thou haſt driven me out this day from the face of the earth, and from thy Face ſhall I be hid. And Cain went out from the Preſence of the Lord,</hi> Gen. 4.13, 14, 16. That is, he was deprived of the light of God's Countenance; filled with Horrour in his ſpirit, out of the conſcience of his unpardoned unnaturall Murther of his Brother: God reſpected not his Offering, admitted him not to any Communion with himſelf, let the infernall Spirits haunt him, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered him into the hands of the Devil.</p>
            <p>And this moſt horrible eſtate the Pſalmiſt doth here deprecate; ſince the conſcience of his Guilt made him ſenſible that he might juſtly expect it.</p>

                  <hi>That God's Preſence of Grace is moſt deſirable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How deſirable the Preſence of God's Favour is to men, may appear by that Dialogue between God and <hi>Moſes,</hi> which we meet with <hi>Exod.</hi> 33.14, 15. wherein, after God had made that terrible Commination, of <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming up into the midſt of the people of Iſrael in a moment to conſume them,</hi> becauſe of their great Provocation of him in making the Golden Calf, and <hi>not to goe up with them,</hi> verſ. 3, 5. and <hi>Moſes,</hi> verſ. 12, 13. had inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made Supplication for God's Guidance in that great Expedition which he put him upon, of bringing the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Iſrael</hi> into the Land of <hi>Canaan;</hi> the Lord tells him, that <hi>his Preſence ſhould goe with him, and he would give him reſt. Moſes</hi> replies to God, <hi>If thy Preſence goe not with us, carry us not up hence.</hi> And gives this reaſon, verſ. 16. <hi>For wherein ſhall it be known here that I and thy people have found grace in thy ſight? is it not in that thou goeſt with us?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From which paſſage may be diſcerned how much <hi>Moſes</hi> valued God's Preſence, as that without which he counted all his Undertakings as vain; that he could not effect any thing proſperouſly, not ſubdue Enemies, nor rule that people, nor ſucceſſively accompliſh any undertaking: But on the other ſide, with God's Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence he doubted not but that he ſhould bring to paſs that great Buſineſs, and all other Deſigns which he ſhould be put upon, if God did vouchſafe it to him.</p>
               <p>The ſame is true in our Spirituall Voiage towards Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and our Chriſtian Warfare. The Preſence of God is
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:42122:50"/>All in all; without God's Preſence we can doe nothing: though we ſhould have all the furniture of wit, ſtrength, wealth, and the aſſiſtence of men; yet ſhould we not be able to goe one ſtep forward in the way to Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: <hi>we of our ſelves ſhould not be ſufficient to think any thing as of our ſelves, for all our Sufficiency is of God,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.5. Yea our Adverſary the Devil would eaſily devour us, if the Lord ſhould depart from us. On the other ſide, <hi>If God be for us, who can be againſt us? Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther life, nor death, nor Angels, nor Principalities, nor Powers, nor things preſent, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature ſhall prevail againſt us.</hi> The auxiliary force of God's Preſence makes a Believer, in <hi>Tribulation, diſtreſs, perſecution, famine, nakedneſs, peril, ſword,</hi> to be <hi>more then a Conquerour,</hi> even to triumph and to glory in the Lord; as knowing that his Riches exceed <hi>Croeſus</hi> his wealth, his Glory <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>'s glory; and that he may truly ſay, without Thra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonicall vaunting, <hi>Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things preſent, or things to come, All are mine, I being Chriſt's, and Chriſt God's,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.22, 23.</p>
               <p>Thus did the Pſalmiſt expreſs his apprehenſions of the benefit of God's Preſence in relation to his Safety, Comfort, and Happineſs. That <hi>he reſtored his Soul, and led him in the paths of Righteouſneſs for his Name's ſake. Yea, though he did walk through the valley of the ſhadow of death, he would fear no evil: for God was with him, his Rod and his Staff did comfort him,</hi> Pſal. 23.3, 4. That <hi>his Goodneſs and Mercy ſhould follow him all the days of his life,</hi> verſ. 6. That <hi>he would ſhew him the path of Life: in his Preſence was fulneſs of Joy, at his right hand Pleaſures for evermore,</hi> Pſal. 16.11.</p>
               <p>As to be near ſuch a King as <hi>Solomon,</hi> was counted ſo great a Happineſs, that the bleſſedneſs of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:42122:51"/>Courtiers was magnified with admiration by the Queen of <hi>Sheba:</hi> ſo much more bleſſed are they that are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with God, and are near to him. <hi>In his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour is their life,</hi> Pſal. 30.5. <hi>The light of his Countenance is better then life it ſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Man being <hi>Animal ſociabile,</hi> a ſociable Living crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, needs Society: it is moſt joyous for him to be with them whom he loves, and who love him, and can help him. But ſuch is none now in compariſon of God, and therefore no Company (to a Holy heart) like to God's. <hi>David</hi>'s <hi>Soul thirſted for God, panted after him, to come and appear before him.</hi> But <hi>his Tears were his meat day and night</hi> in his abſence from God; and it was <hi>as a Sword in his bones</hi> to be reproached with this demand, <hi>Where is thy God?</hi> When <hi>God hid his face, he was troubled.</hi> Which comes to paſs by our departing from God: and that brings me to the</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>That the committing of great and enormous Sins en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangers the Privation of God's Preſence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is true, that God ſometimes, to try his moſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right Servants, doth withdraw from them the light of his Countenance; not out of Indignation againſt them, for any great Tranſgreſſion committed by them. Thus he dealt with <hi>Job,</hi> when he exerciſed his Patience: which made him expoſtulate the matter with God, <hi>Job</hi> 13.24. <hi>Wherefore hideſt thou thy face, and holdeſt me for thine Enemy?</hi> verſ. 26. <hi>For thou writeſt bitter things againſt me, and makeſt me to poſſeſs the Iniquities of my youth.</hi> And <hi>Heman</hi> the <hi>Ezrahite,</hi> Pſal. 88.14. <hi>Lord, why caſteſt thou off my Soul? why hideſt thou thy Face from me?</hi> But this caſting off and hiding God's Face is but for a time, and not in wrath, but like a Father's
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:42122:51"/>dealing with his Child, when he for a little while ſeque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters himſelf, to make experiment of his Child's Affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to excite him thereby to ſeek him the more earneſtly.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſs even this alſo tends to bring them to the acknowledgment of their Sins: therefore the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Hoſea</hi> (5.15.) brings in God thus ſaying, <hi>I will goe away and return to my place, till they acknowledge their Offence, and ſeek my Face: in their Affliction they will ſeek me early.</hi> Even <hi>Job</hi> wanted God's Preſence, till he confeſſed himſelf vile, and <hi>repented, abhorring himſelf in duſt and aſhes,</hi> Job 42.6.</p>
               <p>But there is a more direfull Caſting out of God's Preſence with utter Forſaking, ſo as to caſt a people or perſon out of his ſight for ever; by leaving them to be a Prey to thoſe who waſte and oppreſs them: as when he threatned, <hi>Jerem.</hi> 7.15. to <hi>caſt the Jews out of his ſight, as he had caſt out all their brethren, the whole ſeed of Ephraim:</hi> which he accompliſhed in the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byloniſh</hi> Captivity, as it is <hi>Jerem.</hi> 52.3. <hi>Through the Anger of the Lord it came to paſs in Jeruſalem and Judah,</hi> that God <hi>caſt them out of his Preſence;</hi> eſpecially <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of all the Provocations that Manaſſeh had provoked him withall,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 23.26. And indeed, though <hi>Manaſſeh,</hi> repenting, was not utterly and for ever caſt out of God's Preſence; yet by reaſon of the hainouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Sins, <hi>the Lord brought upon him and his people the Captains of the hoaſt of the King of Aſſyria, which took him among the thorns, and bound him with fetters, and carried him to Babylon,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 33.11.</p>
               <p>And <hi>David</hi> himſelf, when he had by his great Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions provoked the Lord to Anger in the matter of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah</hi> the <hi>Hittite,</hi> found God's favourable Preſence ſo removed from him, that in his Houſe he ſuffered by his Children great Calamities, which were inflicted by
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:42122:52"/>God to ſhew his Indignation: ſo that though he were not <hi>Filius Irae,</hi> a Child of Wrath, caſt away with ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Dereliction as a Reprobate; yet he was <hi>Filius ſub Ira,</hi> a Child under Wrath for that preſent, which made him dread his Danger, and to be thus importunate with God, not to <hi>caſt him out of his Preſence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And indeed in caſe of great Sins committed preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſly againſt Warning, or Conſcience enlightned, and continued in with Impenitency, it is inconſiſtent with God's Holineſs and Honour to afford his Preſence; it being contrary to his Nature and Glory to counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance Evil, who <hi>is not a God that hath pleaſure in Wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs, neither ſhall Evil dwell with him. The fooliſh ſhall not ſtand in his ſight; he hateth all workers of Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,</hi> Pſal. 5.4, 5. <hi>He is of purer eyes then to behold Evil, and cannot look on Iniquity,</hi> Hab. 1.13.</p>
               <p>As it is with a gallant Prince, who cannot brook a baſe Coward; or a neat and cleanly Nobleman, who cannot endure in his company a ſordid and naſty Slo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, but will thruſt or keep ſuch out of his preſence: ſo it is with God. When a Man or Nation have defiled themſelves with ſuch odious Iniquities as God abhors, till they be waſhed with true Repentance, and new cloathed by putting on the Lord <hi>Jeſus,</hi> there is no hope of finding God ready to admit them near to him.

               <p>The Holy Writings are full of ſuch Petitions as theſe. <hi>Let my ſentence come forth from thy preſence,</hi> Pſal. 17.2.

                  <hi>Make thy Face to ſhine upon thy ſervant,</hi> Pſal. 31.16. <hi>Forſake me not, O Lord; O my God, be not far from me,</hi> Pſal. 38.21. <hi>Awake, why ſleepeſt thou, O Lord? ariſe, caſt us not off for ever.

As it is with a Child who miſſeth his Father, he cries after him, till he appears to him; or as a Traveller that is out of his way, and knoweth not what way to take, nor what may become of him, calls for his Guide to direct, for his Company to help him: So it is with a Repenting perſon, who hath wandered out of his way; he is ſenſible that he hath done fooliſhly in leaving God's way, fears leſt he ſhall become a prey to Satan, finds the want of God's Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, the need of his Aſſiſtence: hereupon he cries aloud to God not to leave him; he wraſtleth with God, as <hi>Jacob</hi> did when he feared his Brother <hi>Eſau</hi>'s hoſtile approach, ſo as <hi>not to let him goe untill he bleſs him;</hi> he <hi>weeps and makes Supplication,</hi> till he becomes an <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaac,</hi> one that <hi>prevails with God;</hi> his Eye trickleth down and ceaſeth not, without any intermiſſion, till the Lord look down, and behold from Heaven; he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wails his turning aſide into crooked paths, begs to be led into the way everlaſting; and to that end reſolves to hold cloſe to God for the time to come, and to keep his way, leſt he (by Recidivation and Relapſe) drive away God for ever. For which purpoſe he begs God <hi>not to take away his Holy Spirit from him,</hi> as being his beſt Guide and Guard in his Pilgrimage on Earth.

                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah,</hi> as he ſincerely confeſſeth his Sin, and humbly beggeth Pardon, ſo he doth earneſtly deprecate God's Dere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liction of him, as being the moſt ſad preſage of his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting Perdition; and the <hi>taking away his Holy Spirit from him,</hi> as the inlet to Satan's poſſeſſion of him, and ſo the forerunner of his extreme Ruine.</p>
            <p>I have heretofore conſidered his Petition againſt Ejection out of God's Preſence; the regaining of which is a moſt deſirable thing to a Penitent Sinner; and though it be forfeited by Sin, yet is it recoverable by humble and earneſt Supplication. It now remains that I conſider the other Prayer in my Text, againſt the Privation of God's Spirit, in theſe words, <hi>And take not thy Holy Spirit from me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For explication whereof, it is requiſite that it be
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:42122:55"/>ſhewed, 1. What is meant by <hi>the Holy Spirit,</hi> or <hi>Spirit of God's Holineſs,</hi> which he feared might be <hi>taken from him:</hi> 2. How it is <hi>taken away</hi> from a perſon.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The term <hi>Spirit</hi> is meant ſometimes of God the Father, as <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.24. where it is ſaid that <hi>God is a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit:</hi> ſometimes of the Son, as 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.17. where it is ſaid, <hi>The Lord is that Spirit:</hi> and ſometimes of the Third Perſon in the Holy Trinity, as 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.6. where it is ſaid, <hi>It is the Spirit that beareth witneſs;</hi> who is termed the Holy Ghoſt, or Spirit, and is all one with the <hi>Spirit of his Holineſs</hi> in my Text. Now he is ſo termed in oppoſition to the <hi>unclean Spirit,</hi> Matth. 12.43. or <hi>evil Spirit,</hi> and <hi>Spirit of Devils,</hi> which are in ſome men, as the Holy Spirit is in others. For as the Heathens imagined that every man had his good <hi>Genius</hi> or his bad, his good or bad Angel: ſo the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture expreſſeth the Motions of men to be from the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God's Holineſs, in them who are ſanctified; and from Satan, in them who are unholy, as in <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Judas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the Spirit of God is ſometimes ſpoke of as God's Inſtrument by which he works in the works of Creation. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.30. <hi>Thou ſendeſt forth thy Spirit, they are created; and thou reneweſt the face of the Earth. Job</hi> 33.4. <hi>The Spirit of God hath made me, and the breath of the Almighty hath given me life.</hi> When God bringeth any great thing to paſs, he doth it by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. <hi>Zech.</hi> 4.6. <hi>Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit.</hi> That which is in <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.28. <hi>If I caſt out De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils by the Spirit of God,</hi> is in <hi>Luk.</hi> 11.20. <hi>If I with the finger of God caſt out Devils:</hi> whence it appears, that the Spirit of God is <hi>Digitus Dei,</hi> God's Hand or Finger, whereby he works. But eſpecially the works God doeth in and for the Saints are aſcribed to the Spirit of God. <hi>All theſe things worketh that one and the ſelf-ſame
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:42122:55"/>Spirit, dividing to every man ſeverally even as he will,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.11. All thoſe precious Qualities and Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations whereby we pleaſe God are termed <hi>Fruits of the Spirit,</hi> Gal. 5.22, 23.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This helps us to underſtand how the Holy Spirit may be <hi>taken from a perſon;</hi> to wit, by withdrawing from him thoſe Operations of the Holy Spirit which are amiable to God, or comfortable to us. Now in this Petition it is to be conſidered, that notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <hi>David</hi>'s Sins, he was not utterly bereft of God's Spirit: for in this Pſalm, his humble Confeſſion, his ardent Supplication, ſhew that there was ſome fire of God's Spirit remaining in him, all the ſparks were not gone out. Yet he felt ſo little of the Vigour and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation of the Spirit, that he feared its utter Extincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And becauſe this would leave him in utter Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, therefore he is importunate with God, that he would <hi>not take his Holy Spirit from him;</hi> but, as it is in the next verſe, <hi>reſtore unto him the joy of his Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and uphold him with his free Spirit.</hi>

               <p>This is manifeſt from the words of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> Luk. 11.13. <hi>If ye then, being evil, know how to give good Gifts to your Children; how much more ſhall your heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?</hi> Which ſhews that the Gift of the Holy Spirit is a greater Gift, and far better, then that which earthly Parents give to their Children, as bodily Food, and the like: and that God, in <hi>giving his Holy Spirit to thoſe that ask him,</hi> ſhews an Affection far exceeding that which Parents have for their Children, when they ſupply them with Corporall ſuſtenance. Adde hereunto, that the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.14. in his Benediction of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> prays thus for them, <hi>The Grace of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and the Love of God, and the Communion of the Holy Spirit, be with you all, Amen.</hi> Whereby it is manifeſt, that the <hi>Communion of the Holy Spirit</hi> is ranked among the beſt things he could beg for that people, to wit, the <hi>Grace of Chriſt,</hi> and the <hi>Love of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor is this without reaſon: for the Spirit of God removes all that Evil which is odious to God, and noi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to our ſelves; it waſhes away that <hi>Filthineſs of fleſh and ſpirit</hi> which is loathſome to God; it cures that Blindneſs of Mind, that Hardneſs of Heart, that Perverſeneſs of Soul, that Impotency of Faculties, which make us unable to doe any thing that may pleaſe God, or rectify our own Actions. It is this clean Water which, being <hi>ſprinkled</hi> on us by God, makes us <hi>clean</hi> in his eyes, ſo as to <hi>cleanſe us from all our Filthineſs</hi> and all our Evils. It is that, by giving of which, we have <hi>a new heart, and a new ſpirit is put within us:</hi> God <hi>takes away the ſtony heart out of our fleſh,</hi> and <hi>gives us an heart of fleſh,</hi> which cauſeth us to <hi>walk in God's Statutes, and to keep his Judgments, and doe them,</hi> Ezek. 11.19, 20.</p>
               <p>In whom the Spirit of God dwells not, there is a
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:42122:56"/>
                  <hi>Spirit of Slumber, Eyes that they ſhould not ſee, and Ears that they do not hear:</hi> even <hi>the Goſpel is hid to them; the God of this world blinds their minds, leſt the Light of the glorious Goſpel of Chriſt, who is the Image God, ſhould ſhine unto them:</hi> they are held in <hi>the Snare of the Devil,</hi> and <hi>are taken captive by him at his will.</hi> An evil Spirit poſſeſſeth them, ſo that they want the Conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of God, <hi>the Peace which paſſeth underſtanding,</hi> which <hi>guards the minds</hi> of them that believe <hi>through Chriſt Jeſus:</hi> they are filled with Horrour of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, are under <hi>the ſpirit of Bondage:</hi> they <hi>ſow to the Fleſh, and of the Fleſh reap Corruption.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On the other ſide, where the Spirit of God inhabits, it <hi>renews</hi> a man <hi>in the ſpirit of his mind,</hi> ſo that <hi>he knows the things that are freely given him of God;</hi> ſpiritually diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns <hi>the hidden wiſedom of God in a myſtery, which God hath ordained before the world to our glory;</hi> even thoſe things <hi>which eye hath not ſeen, nor ear heard, nor have entred into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.</hi> Even <hi>to Babes are theſe things revealed</hi> by God's Spirit, <hi>which the Princes of the world knew not,</hi> but they were <hi>hid from the wiſe and prudent,</hi> Matth. 11.25. Whence it is, that they are made <hi>the Epiſtle of Chriſt, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in Tables of Stone, but in fleſhly Tables of the Heart: with open face behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, as in a glaſs, the Glory of the Lord, they are chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged into the ſame image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.3, 18. By which means they are made <hi>the Temple of God,</hi> in that <hi>the Spirit of God dwelleth in them,</hi> verſ. 16. and <hi>holy unto God, an habitation of God through the Spirit:</hi> they are <hi>joyned to the Lord, one Spirit</hi> with him; <hi>new Creatures in Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>conformed to him.</hi> Whence it is that <hi>Sin bath not dominion over them, nor the Wicked one toucheth
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:42122:57"/>them.</hi> They are <hi>delivered from the Law, that being dead wherein they were held; that they might bring forth fruit unto God; ſerve in the newneſs of the Spirit, and not in the oldneſs of the Letter.</hi> For though <hi>the Letter</hi> of the Law <hi>killeth,</hi> being <hi>the miniſtration of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation;</hi> yet <hi>the Spirit giveth Life,</hi> being <hi>the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of Righteouſneſs,</hi> which <hi>exceeds in glory.</hi> And conſequently, they have <hi>liberty by the Spirit of God;</hi> are beautified by it, ſo as that <hi>Chriſt is formed in them.</hi> They <hi>live in the Spirit,</hi> and <hi>walk in the Spirit. The mind of the Spirit is</hi> to them <hi>life and peace.</hi> They <hi>have acceſs by one Spirit unto the Father.</hi> The Spirit of God is <hi>the Spirit of Adoption, whereby they cry, Abba Father. The Spirit it ſelf beareth witneſs with their ſpirit, that they are the Children of God: and if Children, then Heirs, heirs of God, and joynt-heirs with Chriſt; that ſuffering with him, they may be glorified together.</hi> They are <hi>led by the Spirit; ſow to the Spirit,</hi> and <hi>of the Spirit reap life everlaſting; through the Spirit, wait for the hope of Righteouſneſs which is by Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In a word, that Life, that Holineſs, that Beauty, that Liberty, that Joy, that Hope, that Fruit which a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian hath from <hi>Chriſt,</hi> is communicated by the Spirit; and that Glory of Soul and Body which is expected hereafter, that Quietneſs and Reſt in life and death which is deſirable, is from the Spirit of God. <hi>If any man have not the Spirit of Chriſt, he is none of Chriſt's: But if Chriſt be in us, the Body is dead, becauſe of Sin; but the Spirit is life, becauſe of Righteouſneſs. And if the Spirit of him that raiſed up Jeſus from the dead dwell in us, he that raiſed up Chriſt from the dead ſhall alſo quicken our mortal bodies by the Spirit that dwelleth in us,</hi> Rom. 8.9, 10, 11.</p>
               <p>So that I may ſafely infer from this enumeration of Benefits, even the moſt precious Riches that a Spirit
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:42122:57"/>is capable of, that the Gift of God's Spirit to a man is the greateſt Commodity, the Jewel of Heaven. What <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith of Wiſedom, is true of God's Spirit: It is a Gift <hi>more precious then Rubies, and all the things we can deſire are not to be compared to it.</hi> And therefore the Loſs of it is the greateſt Loſs. Which brings me to the Enquiry what endangers the Privation of it; and that was aſſerted, in the Second Propoſition, to be great Tranſgreſſions.</p>

                  <hi>That great Tranſgreſſions endanger the Loſs of God's Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is manifeſt from <hi>David</hi>'s Petition, in that by reaſon of his Sins he was afraid of its Loſs, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore begs the Continuance of it, notwithſtanding his foul Treſpaſſes.</p>
               <p>It is, I confeſs, a great Diſpute, Whether a perſon once regenerated by the Spirit, <hi>waſhed, ſanctified,</hi> and <hi>juſtified in the name of the Lord Jeſus, and by the Spirit of our God,</hi> can totally and finally loſe its Continuance with him. I will not meddle with that Point: But this is out of queſtion, That ſome Gifts of the Spirit may be loſt; elſe the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.19. would not have premoniſhed the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> that they ſhould <hi>not quench the Spirit.</hi> Such Gifts of the Spirit as are for others good, to which the Salvation of a perſon is not promiſed, may undoubtedly be totally loſt by great Tranſgreſſions. So <hi>Saul</hi> loſt the Royal Magnanimity and other Princely Endowments which he had before, by ſparing <hi>Agag,</hi> and by uſurping the Prieſtly Office in offering Sacrifice. <hi>Judas</hi> loſt the Gift of Healing which he had with the reſt of the Apoſtles, and other Abilities to preach the Goſpell, by his trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tourous
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:42122:58"/>Selling of his Maſter: he fell from the Apoſtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and Miniſtry by his Tranſgreſſion. Nor is it denied, but that ſome <hi>who were once enlightned, and had taſted of the heavenly Gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghoſt, and had taſted of the good Word of God, and the powers of the world to come,</hi> might <hi>fall away,</hi> and <hi>not be renewed again by Repentance;</hi> that they might <hi>crucifie the Son of God afreſh, and put him to an open ſhame;</hi> that they might <hi>tread under foot the Son of God, and count the Bloud of the Covernant, wherewith they were ſanctified, an unholy thing, and doe deſpite to the Spirit of grace,</hi> Heb. 6.4, 5, 6. and 10.29.</p>
               <p>Yea, thoſe of whom God gave teſtimony, that they <hi>did that which was right in the eyes of God, as did Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid;</hi> yet even they fell ſo foully, as that they loſt the Fruits and Comforts of the Spirit, ſo as not to regain them in that degree they once had them. Of <hi>Aſa</hi> it is ſaid, that <hi>his Heart was perfect with the Lord all his days,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 15.14. and yet he put the Seer in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, being in a rage with him for reproving his Rely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the King of <hi>Syria,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16.7, 10. and even <hi>in his Diſeaſe he ſought not to the Lord, but to the phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians,</hi> verſ. 12. And <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> though he <hi>walked be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God in truth and with a perfect Heart,</hi> and <hi>did that which was good in his ſight;</hi> yet when <hi>God left him to try him, that he might know all that was in his Heart, he rendred not again according to the benefit done unto him: for his Heart was lifted up,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 32.25, 31.</p>
               <p>Certain it is, by <hi>David</hi>'s and other Holy mens ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, that God doth ſometimes leave men to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for a time, ſo as to fall into ſuch Sins as deprive them of the Joy of God's Salvation, and the eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing virtue of God's Spirit; ſo as not to be ſo active and conſtant in the exerciſe of Godlineſs as formerly; at leaſt for a time: elſe why doth <hi>David</hi> pray, in the
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:42122:58"/>next verſe to my Text, <hi>Reſtore unto me the Joy of thy Salvation, and uphold me with thy free Spirit?</hi> And however the event be, yet there is great danger of an utter Loſs of the Spirit of God, not onely in reſpect of its Comforts and Motions, but alſo of its inexiſtence and quickening virtue, when men are ſo overcome by Luſt as <hi>Solomon</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> or Fear as <hi>Peter,</hi> or other Temptations, to ſin ſo foully as they did.</p>
               <p>The Reaſon whereof is, becauſe ſuch Sins do grieve and vex the Holy Spirit. For though the Spirit of God be not ſubject to humane Paſſions; yet the Holy Scripture, as it aſcribes Repentance and ſome other Affections of men to God, ſo doth it attribute Grief to the Holy Spirit, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.30. where it minds us that we <hi>grieve not the Holy Spirit of God, whereby we are ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led unto the day of redemption,</hi> in reſpect of the effect that Grief hath in man, which makes him withdraw from that which grieves him. And ſo ſaith the Book intituled the <hi>Wiſedom of Solomon,</hi> Chap. 1.4, 5. <hi>For into a malicious Soul Wiſedom ſhall not enter, nor dwell in the body that is ſubject to Sin. For the holy Spirit of diſcipline will fly deceit, and remove from thoughts that are without underſtanding, and will not abide where <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs cometh in. Contraria ſe invicem expellunt:</hi> There is a Contrariety between God's Spirit of Holineſs, and man's ſpirit that loves or yields to Unholineſs; and therefore they conſiſt not together. And God doth alſo juſtly deprive perſons of that great Gift of his Spirit, when they reſiſt it, when they vex it, ſo as to make it become their Enemy: as Princes take away their Favours and Offices and Honours which they have conferred, when they are contemned, and abuſed againſt them. And therefore a Penitent Sinner, being ſenſible of his Danger, deprecates the ablation of God's Spirit, though deſerved by his Sin, as <hi>David</hi> in my Text, which is the</p>

                  <hi>That a Repenting Sinner is an earneſt Suitour to God for the Continuance of his Spirit to him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is the dolefull Expoſtulation of the people of God, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63.17. who had <hi>rebelled, and vexed God's Spirit,</hi> ſo as to make <hi>him their Enemy,</hi> verſ. 10. when they repented, and diſcerned their Errour, and beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged his Return, <hi>O Lord, why haſt thou made us to erre from thy ways, and hardened our heart from thy Fear? return for thy ſervants ſake.</hi> They at laſt find the miſs of God's Spirit, as that which yielded them the greateſt Safety and chiefeſt Happineſs. They find that they, by their not cheriſhing God's Spirit, but unkind uſage, have driven away their beſt Friend. They ſee that, by their Security, they have let in their greateſt Enemy.</p>
               <p>In a word, when a Sinner hath found his Miſery by acting that Sin which forfeits his intereſt in the Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance and Aſſiſtence of God's Spirit, he bewails it, and fears left an evil Spirit ſhould poſſeſs him, and bring with it <hi>ſeven more</hi> unclean <hi>ſpirits, worſe then it ſelf,</hi> when his <hi>houſe is empty, ſwept, and garniſhed,</hi> and <hi>dwell in him,</hi> and ſo <hi>his end be worſe then his beginning;</hi> as it is <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.44, 45. And therefore he begs for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of God's Spirit, leſt the unclean Spirit poſſeſs him, as it did <hi>Saul. David</hi> therefore ſo earneſtly here deprecates the Loſs of the Holy Spirit, as remembring what befell his Predeceſſour <hi>Saul:</hi> which all Penitent Sinners ſhould likewiſe dread.</p>

               <p>Now then, it concerns us all to prize the Preſence and Virtue of God's Spirit in us, as the great Gift of
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:42122:59"/>Heaven; and to take heed how we forfeit it by our Sins: which if we have done, let us by Repentance bewail our Forfeiture of it, and beg of God the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of it, notwithſtanding our deſert to be depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of it.</p>
               <p>We count the Titles and Enſigns of the Favour of a King, the Robes and Proclamations by which he ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours a Subject, of great worth. <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s and <hi>Morde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cai</hi>'s riding and cloathing by the Kings of <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Perſia</hi> were highly accounted of; and the Loſs of ſuch Advancement was terrible to <hi>Haman</hi> and others: and Fear of like Diſgrace makes men beg that they may not be deprived of them.</p>
               <p>The having of God's Spirit is as the Seal of God, as a Robe or Diadem, as the Enſign of the Order of the King of Heaven, as that which aſſures our inſtatement in the rank of Nobles, which are as Angels before God.</p>
               <p>Oh let us then value it far above all the Enſigns of Favour and Honour by which the greateſt Kings on earth teſtifie their reſpect to their Favourites. Let us take heed of rebelling, and vexing the Holy Spirit of God, leſt he become our Enemy, and ſight againſt us. If we have by Sin endangered our Loſs of it, let us beg earneſtly its Reſtitution: and take heed of Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Remiſsneſs in <hi>ſowing to the Spirit,</hi> of Barren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Unfruitfulneſs in bringing forth the Fruits of the Spirit; leſt we loſe its Comforts and Operations, and our caſe be like <hi>Saul</hi>'s, that <hi>the Spirit of God depart from</hi> us, <hi>and an evil Spirit from the Lord poſſeſs</hi> us for ever.</p>
               <p>It is a very ſad thing, that any, in mockery and ſcorn, ſhould deride the work of God's Spirit, eſpecially in fervent Prayer; that any ſhould counterfeit it; that any ſhould aſcribe that to God's Spirit, which is but

            <p>By the <hi>Spirit</hi> is no doubt meant the Soul of man, with its vital Faculties, his Reaſon, Will, and Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; of which the Apoſtle ſpeaks 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.11. <hi>For what man hath known the things of a man, ſave the Spirit of a man which is in him?</hi> But then it muſt be underſtood of the Spirit of a man in its Rectitude and Integrity, oppoſite to a <hi>wounded Spirit,</hi> as the Antitheſis in the latter part of the verſe ſhews.</p>
            <p>This Rectitude or Integrity of the Spirit conſiſts,</p>
            <p n="1">1. In the right uſe of Reaſon, which is indeed the Sinews of the Spirit. The leſs there is of Reaſon, the more is the imbecillity of the Spirit: and the weaker the Mind, the leſs is the Patience. Children can bear nothing: upon every Laſh, every motion of a Rod, preſently they cry; an ugly Vizor, any ſtrange Noiſe or unexpected Accident affrights them. So it is with weak-ſpirited perſons; they are ready to faint at every Threat, every Frown of a Superiour: they think every Symptom of a Diſeaſe preſageth Death, and preſently the Phyſician muſt be fetcht; every Rumour of War puts them to a ſtand what to doe, where to be; every Loſs is as if they were undone; every Difficulty ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended is as <hi>a Lion in the way.</hi>

            <p>When <hi>Gideon</hi> bids <hi>Jether</hi> his firſt-born, up and ſlay <hi>Zeba</hi> and <hi>Zalmunna;</hi> though they were in his hands, under his feet, yet the youth <hi>drew not his ſword: for he feared, becauſe he was yet a youth,</hi> Judg. 8.20. <hi>Riſe thou,</hi> ſaid they then to <hi>Gideon, and fall upon us: for as the man is, ſo is his ſtrength.</hi> As is the man's Reaſon and Underſtanding, ſo is his Courage and Fortitude of Spirit. <hi>Mens cujuſque is eſt quiſque.</hi> It is not the height of the Stature, nor the bigneſs of the Bone, nor the length of the Arm, nor the vigour of the Members,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:42122:62"/>that inable a perſon to bear or act. A little man with a lively Spirit can fight better then a Giant that is ſlow in motion, and dull in contrivance: a cunning <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes</hi> will overcome Difficulties, and bear Storms, better then a luſty <hi>Ajax.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Neceſſitas fortiter ferre docet, Conſuetudo facilé.</hi> Men that have much Wit to find ways of evaſion, Skill to apply themſelves to perſons and times, to foreſee Means and Events, will wind themſelves out of Troubles; when a man of a rude and boiſterous Spirit, by his ſelf-vexing, his fretfulneſs and fuming, doth but ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per himſelf the more, like the Bird that flutters in the Net. Cuſtome alſo makes many a Diſeaſe born with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Diſquietneſs, many a dangerous Storm adventured through without Fear. The more Experience men have of overcoming Afflictions, the more are they ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med againſt them. Any way whereby Reaſon is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, Infirmities are abated. The Foreſight of Evils approaching makes them the leſs formidable. Thoſe Darts pierce leaſt, which are foreſeen beſt. Reaſon is indeed a Buckler that bears off many Blows, which would cut a Fool to the heart. The Argument of the Apoſtle is rational, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.13. <hi>There hath no Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion taken you, but ſuch as is common to men,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhould be born. <hi>Ferre quam ſortem patiuntur om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, Nemo recuſat,</hi> is Reaſon in the Poet.</p>
            <p>How admirable were the Reſolutions, how conſtant were the Actings of ſpirit in <hi>Stoicks,</hi> in bearing their Sufferings by the help of Philoſophy? Pains of the Stone, Torture of the Rack, were ſtoutly born with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Groan, upon ſuch Apprehenſions as theſe: This Evil reacheth not Me, but my Sheath; what is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to me with Beaſts, not that which is mine. The Writings of <hi>Seneca, Epictetus, Suetonius,</hi> and others, are full to this purpoſe: ſo are the Relations of the
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:42122:62"/>Lives of Philoſophers. Certain it is, that for the ſuſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of humane Evils, Prudence is much availing. That of <hi>Solomon</hi> is true of it, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 7.19. <hi>Wiſedom ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theneth the wiſe, more then ten mighty men which are in the City.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. But then, 2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>, Reaſon is much more ſtrong, when there is with it a <hi>Breaſt-plate of Righteouſneſs,</hi> a Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Uprightneſs. This is indeed Armour of proof, ſuch as no Infirmities, no ſad Accidents can penetrate. Then is the Spirit of a Man whole and ſound, able to bear its Burthens of Afflictions and Injuries, when he is <hi>Integer vitae, Sceleriſque purus,</hi> of an innocent Life, and unſpotted Conſcience. Yea, ſuch hath been the height of Confidence in ſome moral Heathens, ſuch their Heroick Gallantry, that they have provoked the moſt barbarous Tyrants to doe their worſt; have glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly triumphed in the ſevereſt Tortures; have vaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of an undaunted mind, though Heaven and Earth ſhould be tumbled together. <hi>Si fractus illabatur Orbis, Impavidum ferient Ruinae.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What glorious talk have the <hi>Stoicks</hi> of their Vertues, as of themſelves ſufficient to make them happy under any Preſſures? What ſullen (if not well-compoſed) Deportment of Spirit have ſome of them ſhewed under Racks, Strappado's, and ſuch like Engines of Cruelty? What Euthymy or Tranquillity of mind have they had in Sickneſſes, yea in Death, when <hi>(Conſcientia rectè factorum)</hi> the conſciouſneſs of their well-doing, ſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for their Country, hath animated them, like ſtrong <hi>Wine</hi> which <hi>chears the heart?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Holy Believers have (if not with ſo daring a Spirit, yet with a calmer and more gentle Submiſſion to the Will of God) held up their heads under the greateſt Rebukes of God's Hand, or Satan's Malice, when they have appealed to God concerning their Sincerity in
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:42122:63"/>their Obedience to God's Will. When <hi>Hezekiah</hi> was ſick unto death, and <hi>Iſaiah</hi> the Prophet, the Son of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moz,</hi> came unto him, and ſaid, <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, Set thine houſe in order, for thou ſhalt die, and not live;</hi> he <hi>turned his face towards the Wall, and prayed unto the Lord, and ſaid, Remember now, O Lord, I beſeech thee, how I have walked before thee in truth, and with a perfect Heart, and have done that which is good in thy ſight,</hi> Iſa. 38.1, 2, 3. He was under a mortal Diſeaſe, with ſenſe of killing Pain; had a ſharp Meſſage by the Prophet, which might cut him to the heart: yet this did not ſink him, but that he held up, ſo as, in the Conſcience of his Uprightneſs, to urge God to revoke his Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, and lengthen his Life.</p>
            <p>But of all the Inſtances of mere mortal mens endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Afflictions, no Example is like that tranſcendent Mirrour of Patience, holy <hi>Job;</hi> for, notwithſtanding all the Adverſities wherewith Satan had laden him, notwithſtanding the Provocation of his froward Wife, notwithſtanding the injurious Criminations of his evil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurmizing Friends, and the croſs Arguings wherewith they a long while baited him, yet he ſtood firm, fell not into any kind of Dejectedneſs of mind, or Deſpair of a good iſſue out of his Temptations: though he ſwam in rough waters againſt the ſtream, yet he kept up his head. The knowledge of his Purity, the aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of his Witneſs in heaven, ſupported him with ſtrength to undergoe all his Sores, to refute all his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries, to conquer Satan, and to recover out of his Fluctuations, ſo as with greater advantage to get ſafe to Land, and to improve his Loſſes to a greater encreaſe of Favour and Acceptance with God, and temporal Proſperity.</p>
            <p>Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> even when the malignant <hi>Jews</hi> came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him like Bees, and were prepared to ſting him to
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:42122:63"/>death, before their malevolent Council, bore himſelf up with this Proteſtation, that <hi>he had lived in all good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience before God to that day,</hi> Act. 23.1. And this made him bold before <hi>Felix,</hi> when he could ſay in truth, <hi>Herein do I exerciſe my ſelf, to have always a Conſcience void of offence towards God and towards men,</hi> Act. 24.16. When he <hi>reaſoned of Righteouſneſs, Temperance, and Judgment to come,</hi> before <hi>Felix</hi> the Governour, and <hi>Druſilla</hi> his Wife, which was a <hi>Jeweſs,</hi> he was without Fear; whereas <hi>Felix</hi> (whoſe Priſoner he was) <hi>trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,</hi> verſ. 25.</p>
            <p>In a word, though he had Afflictions as much as any, yet in them all he <hi>rejoyced</hi> in this, that he had <hi>the Teſtimony of his Conſcience, that in Simplicity and godly Sincerity, not with fleſhly Wiſedom, but by the Grace of God, he had his Converſation in the world;</hi> even at that time of his Trouble in which he was <hi>preſſed out of meaſure, above ſtrength, inſomuch that he deſpaired even of life,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.8, 12.</p>
            <p n="3">3. But there is yet a third Prop of the Spirit of a man, (beſides right Reaſon, Prudence, and conſcience of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency,) which doth enable it to ſuſtain its Infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties more ſteadily then the reſt; and that is Faith in God through <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> the chief part of the Divine Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oply, or whole Armour of God.</p>
            <p>And indeed Faith is the beſt Cordial to ſuſtain the Spirit of a man in his Infirmities, be they never ſo great: by reaſon of which the ſame Apoſtle could ſay of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf out of experience, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.8, 9, 11. <hi>We are troubled on every ſide, yet not diſtreſſed; we are perplexed, but not in deſpair; perſecuted, but not forſaken; caſt down, but not deſtroyed: always delivered to death for Jeſus ſake;</hi> yet <hi>the ſpirit of Faith,</hi> verſ. 13. ſo upheld him, that, though <hi>the Holy Ghoſt witneſſed in every city, ſaying that Bonds and Afflictions did abide him,</hi> yet <hi>none of
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:42122:64"/>thoſe things did move him,</hi> Act. 20.23, 24. He was ſo rooted and grounded in Faith, that (what-ever inward Decays he found, what-ever outward Storms beat up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, yet) his Spirit ſtood firm with unmovable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution.</p>
            <p>So it was with <hi>David</hi> at <hi>Ziklag:</hi> when his Fellow-ſouldiers with himſelf had their City burnt, their Wives, Children and Goods carried away captive by the <hi>Amalckites,</hi> he was <hi>greatly diſtreſſed; for the people ſpake of ſtoning him, becauſe the ſoul of all the people was grieved, every man for his Sons and for his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters:</hi> yet <hi>he encouraged himſelf in the Lord his God,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 30.6.</p>
            <p>Faith then ſhewed its virtue; it ſtrengthened his Heart, when the reſt of the people in a womaniſh Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row fell a-weeping; and he betook himſelf to God, to inquire what was to be done: which was followed with ſuch Succeſs, that he recovered all that was loſt.</p>
            <p>But what ſpeak I of theſe Infirmities, theſe Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which are nothing in compariſon of what the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Martyrs bare through Faith? of whom we reade, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.35, 36, 37. that though they <hi>were tortured,</hi> yet <hi>they accepted not deliverance, that they might obtain a better Reſurrection:</hi> that when they <hi>had triall of cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el Mockings and Scourgings, of Bonds and Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, were ſtoned, were ſawed aſunder, were tempted, were ſlain with the ſword, were deſtitute, afflicted, tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented,</hi> they could <hi>take joyfully the ſpoiling of their goods,</hi> Heb. 10.34. and ſo contentedly undergoe their Sufferings, as to take their Perſecutours for their beſt Benefactours, and make the ſweeteſt Melody in the moſt ſcorching Flames.</p>
            <p>Innumerable Arguments Faith preſents to the Spirit, from God's Preſence, Appointment, Love, Power, Promiſes, which do invincibly arm a Believer in all
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:42122:64"/>Perils, in all Aſſaults, in all Oppreſſions, and make him invulnerable. Reaſon enables the Spirit of a man to ſuſtain his Infirmities ſtoutly, a good Conſcience comfortably, Faith triumphantly.</p>

               <head>APPLICATION.</head>
               <p>And now give me leave to apply this to your uſe.

               <p>Is there any of you of ſo unſhaken a Spirit, as that none of the things ye feel or fear do in the leaſt move you? Why do you diſtill Hot waters, but to revive you in Faintings? why do you get Friends, but to help you in Troubles? why do you take Phyſick, but to help you in your Infirmities? why do you lay up, ſome Money, others Counſell, but to provide for times of Affliction? But doe you any thing to enable your Spirit to ſuſtain you in your Infirmities? I deny not but the Providence you uſe may be commendable: but if there be no more then that, it will be inſufficient.</p>
               <p>Some Infirmities may be remedied by natural Means; ſome may be prevented by moral Prudence: but the Decumane waves of Sickneſs and Death, the thoughts of Sin's Guilt, and of Judgment to come, require a better Anchour then theſe to keep you up from being drowned, when the Conſcience of the one, and the Fear of the other, beat upon the Veſſel of your Spirit.</p>
               <p>Theſe Storms your Soul will not ride out, without the Conſcience of a Reformed life, without the ſtrong

               <p>Yea, forget not to exerciſe your Faith in God, your Hope in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> continually; that when you ſhall need them, you may not onely have them in habit, but alſo in uſe; not onely in the Root, but alſo in the Fruit.</p>
               <p>Let your Life be a Life of Faith; your Breath be a Breathing of Hope in God: and then you may be aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, though your Body fall to the ground, your <hi>Spirit</hi> will <hi>mount upward to God that gave it.</hi> Which He grant, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Amen.</p>

            <p>THE Life of man on Earth conſiſts of Action and Paſſion; of Doing his Work, and Bearing his Condition: And in both theſe there are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable Difficulties; ſo that it becomes a hard Task, either to doe what we ought, or to ſuffer as it becometh us. In Doing our Work we are common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unskilfull and ſlothfull: In Bearing our Burthens we are querulous and unquiet. <hi>Man is born like a wild Aſſe's Coli,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Zophar,</hi> Job 11.12.) If you drive him, he will not goe rightly: if you put Burthens on him, he will throw them off if he can; if he cannot remove them, he will wince and kick, eſpecially when his Back is ſore, his Mind galled: in which caſe this of
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:42122:66"/>
               <hi>Solomon</hi> is by much experience found true, <hi>A wounded Spirit who can bear?</hi> So we reade; but the <hi>Vulgar Latin</hi> hath it, <hi>Who ſhall be able to ſuſtain the Spirit that is eaſy to be angry?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the word is more general, and ſignifies not ſo much the Paſſions of one to be born by another; in which caſe it is a truth, That the Wrath, Envy, Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of ſome mens Spirits is intolerable, as it is <hi>Prov.</hi> 27.4. <hi>Wrath is cruel, and Anger is outrageous: but who is able to ſtand before Envy?</hi> But it is rather to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of the perſon's Spirit who is to bear; Who of all men can bear his own Spirit when it is woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded or broken? ſo as in that caſe his own Ability and all other mens is inſufficient to bear up ſuch a woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Spirit. Such a man is <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as the <hi>Greek</hi> expreſſeth it, one that hath but a little life in him. It is onely God that <hi>revives the Spirit of the humble, and revives the Heart of the contrite ones,</hi> Iſa. 57.15.</p>
            <p>Now the Spirit is wounded or broken either by worldly Sorrows; <hi>By Sorrow of the heart the Spirit is broken,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon,</hi> Prov. 15.13. and S. <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.10. <hi>Worldly Sorrow cauſeth death:</hi> or elſe it is bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by the ſenſe of Guilt, and the fear of Wrath. In reſpect of which <hi>David</hi> complains, that his <hi>Bones were broken,</hi> Pſal. 51.8. and more fully <hi>Pſal.</hi> 38.2, &amp;c. <hi>Thine Arrows ſtick faſt in me, and thy Hand preſſeth me ſore. There is no ſoundneſs in my fleſh, becauſe of thine Anger; neither is there any reſt in my bones, becauſe of my Sin. For mine Iniquities are gone over my head; as an heavy burthen, they are too heavy for me to bear. My Wounds ſtink and are corrupt, through my fooliſhneſs. I am trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, I am bowed down greatly, I goe mourning all the day long. For my Loyns are filled with a loathſome diſeaſe, and there is no ſoundneſs in my fleſh. I am feeble and ſore bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken: I have roared by reaſon of the Diſquietneſs of my heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="123" facs="tcp:42122:66"/>
            <p>In both theſe ſorts of Wounds, Experience hath proved the Imbecillity of mens Spirits to bear them, or of any other man to keep them from falling, untill there appear <hi>(Deus è machina)</hi> Divine help from Heaven.</p>
            <p>So that I am to demonſtrate to you, That in the great Preſſures of Spirit (either through worldly Afflictions, or by reaſon of the Conſcience of Sin) no man is able to hold up himſelf from ſinking, nor can any other ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port him, beſides God; with the Reaſon hereof: That God onely makes up the breach, and cloſes the Wounds in the Spirit; and how he doeth it.</p>
            <p>That worldly Croſſes break mens Spirits, ſo as that they are weary of their Lives, is evident in the inſtance of <hi>Ahitophel,</hi> who was counted ſo wiſe a man, that his <hi>Counſel was</hi> reputed <hi>as if a man had inquired of the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of God;</hi> yet barely becauſe he ſaw his Counſell was not followed by <hi>Abſalom,</hi> (God ſo over-ruling the heart of <hi>Abſalom,</hi> that he hearkened to <hi>Huſhai</hi> rather then to himſelf,) his Spirit could not bear this Diſappointment of his Deſign, (to be the grand Miniſter of State under <hi>Abſalom,</hi>) but, in ſtead of diſſembling his Grievance, he <hi>ſaddled his Aſs, got him home to his City, put his houſe in order, hanged himſelf, died, and was buried in the Sepulchre of his Fathers,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17.23. Many more ſuch Examples of men eminent in reſpect of Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, Dignity, Power, Wealth, who upon ſome unexpected Loſs, Fear, perhaps but the angry Looks of a Prince, the Expulſion from Court, or Deprivation of an Office, have been impatient of their Lives, and turned Executioners of themſelves, may be found in Hiſtories, or known by our own Experience.</p>
            <p>And the Reaſon hereof is, from the extreme Folly that is in men, who lay ſo great a ſtreſs of their Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs upon worldly things, that when they fail them,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:42122:67"/>their caſe ſeems deplorable, they have no Buttreſs to keep up their Spirits.</p>
            <p>How great a number are there, that <hi>truſt in uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Riches,</hi> and not <hi>in the living God?</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when the Prop of their Wealth is gone, then all is gone with them; their Hearts are faint, and they caſt away their Life, as if it were an unſupportable Burthen to them.</p>
            <p>How many are there that depend on the Prince's Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and make ſuch account of Preferment by it, that all their ſtudy is to get and keep it, though with the loſs of God's Favour? But that being changeable, and their Hopes thereupon fruſtrated, there is no Acquie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcence in God's Will, but violent Impatience, till they have diſpatcht themſelves.</p>
            <p>How many have ſo ſet their Affections on ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular perſon, (as <hi>Amnon</hi> on <hi>Tamar,</hi>) that they wax lean from day to day, becauſe they cannot obtain their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire? Yea, the Inconſtancy of their Miſtreſs, the miſs of the hoped Match, ſhortens their Lives, brings down their heads with Sorrow to the Grave.</p>
            <p>And it is juſt with God it ſhould be ſo, that thoſe things ſhould be curſed to us, be as blaſted Trees, from which we ſeek that Fruit, that Content, and thoſe En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments, which alone are to be had in God's Favour. When our Hearts wander after ſome Creature, and make it as our God, love it, truſt in it, in ſtead of God himſelf; he will not brook it, but remove it, or make it our Vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation; make it become our Perdition, which was the means of our Corruption.</p>
            <p>This is much more true, when the Spirit is wounded by the Conſcience of Sin againſt God. In the former, there is defect of Love to God; in this, expreſs Enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty againſt him; and therefore it is more intolerable. <hi>Cain</hi>'s Complaint, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.13. verifies this, whether
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:42122:67"/>we reade, <hi>My Puniſhment is greater then I can bear;</hi> or, <hi>Mine Iniquity is greater then that it may be forgiven.</hi> How dolefull was his complaint, when he ſaid, <hi>Behold, thou haſt driven me out this day from the face of the earth, and from thy Face ſhall I be hid, and I ſhall be a Fugitive and a Vagabond in the earth: and it ſhall come to paſs, that every one that findeth me ſhall ſlay me?</hi> verſ. 14. How terribly did the Sting of Conſcience exagitate him, when he <hi>went out from the Preſence of the Lord, and dwelt in the Land of Nod,</hi> as a Renegado from God, and one that was purſued by his own Bloud-guiltineſs?</p>
            <p>Nor is the Caſe of <hi>Judas</hi> leſs pregnant, to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate how furious and inevitable is the purſuit of a guilty Conſcience. He had ſold his Maſter, the Lord of Glory, for thirty pieces of Silver: but his Mony was as <hi>Fire in his Boſome:</hi> the remembrance of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villiſh Act did ſo envenome his Spirit, that he could find no Reſt, till he had diſgorged his Money, and rid himſelf of his Life too. So that of him was verified what <hi>Zophar</hi> ſpake of others, who ſin in like manner, <hi>Job</hi> 20.12, 13, 14, 15, 16. <hi>Though Wickedneſs be ſweet in the Mouth, though a man hide it under his Tongue: Though he ſpare it, and forſake it not, but keep it ſtill within his Mouth: Yet his Meat in his Bowells is turned, it is the Gall of Aſps within him. He hath ſwallowed down Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and he ſhall vomit them up again: God ſhall caſt them out of his Belly. He ſhall ſuck the poiſon of Aſps, the Viper's tongue ſhall ſlay him.</hi> How many Myriads of men have there been in the Ages of the world, who have ventured upon Sin without Fear; have bleſſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the Succeſs of their unrighteous Projects; have delightfully for a ſeaſon ſatiated themſelves with the enjoyment of their prohibited Luſts? yet in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, the Remembrance thereof hath been as a <hi>Fire in their Bones;</hi> as a heavy Burthen, that neither their
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:42122:68"/>own ſtrength nor the help of other men could ſupport them under.</p>
            <p>And the Reaſon hereof is, Becauſe <hi>to them that obey <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrighteouſneſs,</hi> there is <hi>Indignation and Wrath</hi> from God; and conſequently, <hi>Tribulation and Anguiſh upon every Soul of man that doeth evil,</hi> Rom. 2.8, 9. And this is that which makes the Heart to be affected as <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhazzar</hi>'s was: When he ſaw the finger of a man's hand writing over againſt the Candleſtick, and upon the plaiſter of the Wall of the King's Palace, <hi>his Countenance was changed, and his Thoughts troubled him, ſo that the Joynts of his Loyns were looſed, and his Knees ſmote one againſt another.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>How ſhall thy hands be ſtrong</hi> (ſaith God to the <hi>Jews,</hi> Ezek. 22.14.) <hi>when I ſhall deal with thee? The Sinners in Zion are afraid, fearfulneſs hath ſurprized the Hypocrites: who among us ſhall dwell with the devouring fire? who among us ſhall dwell with everlaſting burnings? Iſa.</hi> 33.14. Therefore the Lord ſaith, <hi>I will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend for ever, neither will I be always wroth: for the Spirit ſhould fail before me, and the Souls which I have made,</hi> Iſa. 57.16. Which leads us to that which is intimated,</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>That though the Spirit of man, when it is wounded with worldly Sorrows, or with Conſcience of Sin, cannot ſuſtain it ſelf from ſinking; yet the Lord can and doth ſupport it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is verified by experience in holy <hi>Job,</hi> then whom none was ever more ſorely handled, (except our Lord <hi>Chriſt,</hi> when he <hi>bare our Sins in his Body on the Tree,</hi>) inſomuch that he complained, <hi>Job</hi> 6.4. <hi>For the Arrows of the Almighty are within me, the poiſon whereof
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:42122:68"/>drinketh up my Spirit: the Terrours of God do ſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in array againſt me:</hi> yet did the Conſolations of God ſo ſupport him, that he could allege, <hi>Behold, my Witneſs is in Heaven, and my Record is on high,</hi> Job 16.19. ſo as that he could never be drawn to diſclaim his own Uprightneſs, or God's Righteouſneſs.</p>
               <p>Holy <hi>Paul,</hi> though he were <hi>abundant in Sufferings,</hi> ſo that he had <hi>the ſentence of death in himſelf,</hi> yet he would not relinquiſh his Truſt in God, whom he found <hi>the Father of Mercies, and the God of all Comfort:</hi> ſo as that, with the abounding of his Sufferings, he had alſo abounding Conſolation.</p>
               <p>After the like ſort was it with <hi>Chriſt Jeſus:</hi> who though he was in great Agony in the Garden, ſo that his <hi>Soul was heavy unto death; in the days of his fleſh he offered up Prayers and Supplications, with ſtrong Crying and Tears, unto him that was able to ſave him from death;</hi> yet he <hi>was heard in that he feared,</hi> Heb. 5.7.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>David,</hi> after he had committed that Sin againſt <hi>

               </p>
               <p>The waies that God takes to ſuſtain the Spirits of men in their Infirmities are various. Sometimes by allaying the Sharpneſs of their Afflictions: ſometimes by a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of outward or inward Refreſhings: ſometimes by moderating their Temptations, <hi>not ſuffering them to be tempted above that they are able, but with the Temptation
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:42122:69"/>making a way to eſcape,</hi> that they may be able to bear it; making it ſhort, though it be ſharp.</p>
               <p>But the chief way whereby the Lord ſupports the Spirit, when it ſinks of it ſelf, is by <hi>giving</hi> to ſome <hi>the tongue of the learned, that they may know how to ſpeak a word in ſeaſon to him that is weary,</hi> Iſa. 50.4. whoſe buſineſs it is firſt to humble, to ſearch the Wound; and then to pour in Oil: firſt to diſcover the Malady; and then to apply the Medicine.</p>
               <p>This method is deſcribed at large by <hi>Elihu,</hi> Job 33. from verſ. 15. to v. 29. When <hi>God hath ſpoken to man in ſleep,</hi> and otherwiſe, to <hi>open his ears,</hi> to <hi>ſeal his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction,</hi> to <hi>withdraw him from his purpoſes,</hi> to <hi>hide Pride from man: He chaſteneth him upon his Bed, and the multitude of his Bones with ſtrong pains; ſo that his Soul draweth near unto the Grave, and his Life to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyers.</hi> Yet <hi>if there be a Meſſenger with him, an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter, one among a thouſand, to ſhew unto man his <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>p<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſs,</hi> to make known to him the Atonement which is made by the Bloud of the everlaſting Covenant; when he waſheth himſelf with penitentiall Tears, and <hi>ſprinkles his Conſcience</hi> with the Bloud of <hi>Chriſt</hi> by Faith: <hi>Then he is gracious unto him, and ſaith, Deliver him from going down to the Pit, I have found a Ranſome. He ſhall pray unto God, and he will be favourable unto him; and he ſhall ſee his face with Joy: for he will render unto man his Righteouſneſs.</hi> If when <hi>God looks upon men, they ſay, We have ſinned, and perverted that which was right, and it profited us not: He will deliver their Soul from going into the Pit, and their Life ſhall ſee the Light.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus did <hi>Hezekiah</hi> find it, as he acknowledgeth, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 38.16, 17. <hi>O Lord, by theſe things men live, and in all theſe things is the life of my Spirit:</hi> (that is, by God's <hi>undertaking for him,</hi> verſ. 14.) <hi>ſo wilt thou recover me, and make me to live. Behold, for Peace, I had great
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:42122:69"/>Bitterneſs; but thou haſt in love to my Soul delivered it from the Pit of corruption: for thou haſt caſt all my Sins behind thy back.</hi> Thus he <hi>creates the fruit of the lips, Peace, Peace to him that is afar off, and to him that is near, and heals them,</hi> Iſa. 57.19.</p>
               <p>Men ſin, and then God ſcourgeth; they cry, and God ſends his <hi>Meſſenger</hi> to teach them; they are hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for Sin, and fly to the Bloud of <hi>Chriſt</hi> for Peace: Believing in him, they obtain Reconciliation; being reconciled, the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as <hi>the Comforter,</hi> is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them, to <hi>make known the things that are freely given by God:</hi> hence comes <hi>Joy in believing,</hi> and <hi>Hope</hi> of the <hi>Inheritance</hi> of life, by which they are ſupported; which I was to demonſtrate.</p>

The matter of it is Supplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, with a declaration of the Pſalmiſt's Reſolution or Practice, v. 5, 6. and an Exhortation to wait and hope in God, as he did, with aſſurance of God's Graciouſneſs and Mercifull intention to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> verſ. 7, 8.</p>
            <p>The Supplication expreſſeth the ſtate he was in. <hi>De profundis, Out of the Depths;</hi> that is, <hi>deep Mire</hi> or <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters:</hi> by which are ſignified great Calamities, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69.2, 14, 15. ſuch as thoſe are in that are put into a <hi>Dunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> as <hi>Jeremiah</hi> was, <hi>Jer.</hi> 38.6. or that are caſt into a deep River, Sea or Lake, in which they are like to be

               <p>What this Sin is, and whether any be at this day guilty of it, is a Queſtion that requires ſome diſqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition.

               <p>Proteſtant Divines, taking in other Texts, out of the Epiſtles to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> and out of S. <hi>John</hi>'s 1.

               <p>But the Text, <hi>Mark</hi> 3.30. in which it is added, <hi>Becauſe they ſaid, He hath an unclean Spirit,</hi> doth ſeem to reſtrain it to that ſpightfull belying <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Miracles, (done by the Spirit of God moſt evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently, ſo as that they could not gainſay it,)
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:42122:72" rendition="simple:additions"/>as if they were done by the Prince of Devils, and <hi>Chriſt</hi> were poſſeſſed and acted by an Unclean Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. Which makes it very probable, that none at this day can (as things are) commit it, there being no ſuch Miracles now done, as can evidently ſhew the Operation of the Holy Spirit to be blaſphemed, as it was by the <hi>Phariſees.</hi> Nor is <hi>Julian</hi> the Apoſtate ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently proved (however ſo judged by ſome of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients) to have committed this Sin.</p>
               <p>Much leſs have any of thoſe doubting Souls, who, by reaſon of their Tenderneſs of Conſcience, (which makes them very jealous and fearfull of their own Condition,) have been apt to charge themſelves with this Sin, any reaſon ſo to doe; they being guilty of no ſuch Blaſphemy in words, Rejecting of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> Spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king evil of his Spirit or its Operations, Oppugning of the Goſpel, or the Believers of it; nor of any Obſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in any courſe of open Perſecution, or Diſclaiming <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his Goſpel.</p>
               <p>Perhaps this which I have ſaid may be of great uſe to ſome doubting and troubled Spirits, who put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves on the Rack, through Miſtakes ariſing from the Weakneſs of their Underſtandings, and the Fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of their Hearts.</p>
               <p>As for any other Sins, they are not in their own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture unpardonable: other Blaſphemies are pardonable. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Denying <hi>Chriſt</hi> (though with Curſing himſelf if he knew him, yet) had Pardon. <hi>Manaſſeh,</hi> though notorious for his Cruelties, as filling <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> with inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Bloud, even of the Prophets of God, though infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous for his ſetting up the moſt abominable Idolatries of the Gentiles, though proceeding ſo far as to uſe Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar ſpirits, yet when he was <hi>humbled,</hi> and <hi>prayed to God in his Affliction,</hi> God <hi>heard him,</hi> and forgave him, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 33.12, 13. I inſtance in theſe, as ſeeming to
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:42122:73"/>come nigheſt to the Sin againſt the Holy Ghoſt: the one ſinning againſt Knowledge, after Warning, and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Promiſe to the contrary; the other offending in the moſt hainous manner, in Sins of the greateſt Guilt, with extreme Wilfulneſs and Violence.</p>
               <p>Not to mention the Sins of <hi>David,</hi> or <hi>Lot,</hi> or <hi>Noah,</hi> or <hi>Solomon:</hi> If <hi>Cain</hi> meant it as the <hi>Vulgar Latin</hi> hath it, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.13. <hi>My Sin is greater then can be forgiven;</hi> it might well be replied to him, <hi>Mentiris, Cain, Thou lieſt, Cain:</hi> Thy Sin might have been forgiven, if thou hadſt had a penitent Heart, and hadſt begged Pardon from God. Though in the Law God would not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give ſome Sins, as Blaſphemy, Murther, Adultery, Sins with an high hand, ſo as to expiate them by Sacrifice, and free the Sinner from death: though God ſware to <hi>Eli,</hi> that <hi>the Iniquities of his Houſe ſhould not be purged with Sacrifice nor Offerings for ever,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3.14. though he never will pardon the Sin of Devils, of <hi>Judas</hi> the Son of Perdition, nor the final Impenitent and Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever: Yet <hi>Chriſt</hi> tells us plainly, No kind of Sin or Blaſphemy (except one) but is pardonable to the ſons of men.</p>
               <p n="2">II. But then, upon what Motive God forgiveth Sins, is to be farther conſidered.</p>
               <p>They that ſay that any Sins againſt God are venial <hi>ex genere ſuo,</hi> the whole kind of them of their own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; as having an evil or inordinate thing for their Object, but not againſt the Love of God or our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; or by reaſon of the Smalneſs of the matter in which, or the ſudden Motion by which they are done; ſpeak otherwiſe then the Scripture, which makes <hi>the Wages of Sin</hi> ſimply, and every Sin, <hi>death,</hi> Rom. 6.23. and <hi>him curſed who continues not in every thing written in the Law to doe it,</hi> Gal. 3.10. They derogate from the efficacy of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s <hi>Bloud,</hi> which alone is it that
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:42122:73" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <hi>cleanſeth from all Sin;</hi> make it a light matter to ſin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Moſt high and infinite Majeſty; would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe our Firſt Parents Sin; and harden men in Impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency.</p>
               <p>And when they make voluntary Works of Penance Satisfaction for ſuch Sins, Prieſts Abſolutions, Popes Pardons, and ſaying of Divine Offices for the Sinner, ſufficient to take away the Guilt of Sin againſt God; though they provide for their accurſed Gain, yet they derogate from the Neceſſity and alone Sufficiency of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Bloud, who is the onely <hi>Advocate with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the Propitiation for our Sins, and the Sins of the whole world,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.1, 2.</p>
               <p>We learn <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.22. that <hi>without ſhedding of bloud is no Remiſſion:</hi> and that though the Sacrifices of the Law might procure Forgiveneſs in reſpect of ſome Penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and ſanctify to the purifying of the Fleſh; yet that it is <hi>the Bloud of Chriſt</hi> alone <hi>(who through the eternal Spirit offered himſelf without ſpot to God)</hi> that can <hi>purge our Conſciences from dead works, to ſerve the living God,</hi> verſ. 14. and that it is <hi>for Chriſt's ſake (whom God hath ſet forth to be a Propitiation, through faith in his Bloud, to declare his Righteouſneſs for the Remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Sins that are paſt, through the forbearance of God,</hi> Rom. 3.25.) that God doth <hi>forgive</hi> any Sins of any perſons, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.32. Not for any Saint's or Martyr's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion; or any Surpluſage of Merits in the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury of the Church, diſtributed by the Pope's Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence; or for the bare Work done, of ſaying Maſs, ſinging Dirges, or other Offices, for a perſon deceaſed; or merely for the Prieſt's Abſolution upon Auricular Confeſſion in the Sacrament of Penance; or for any humane Satisfaction whatſoever: but by the Expiation of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Bloud, and his Interceſſion for them to whom Sins are forgiven; though not without their
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:42122:74" rendition="simple:additions"/>due Qualifications, which are next to be conſidered.</p>
               <p n="3">III. The Perſons to whom God forgives Sins are not all whatſoever. There are, that, <hi>after their hardneſs and impenitent Heart, treaſure up unto themſelves Wrath againſt the day of Wrath, and revelation of the righteous Judgment of God,</hi> Rom. 2.5. Nor all that are in the viſible Church, that have been baptized into the Name of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Notwithſtanding <hi>Simon Magus believed, was baptized, continued with Philip, and wondered behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Miracles and Signs which were done:</hi> yet when, by <hi>his offer of Money for the power of beſtowing the Holy Ghoſt, his Heart</hi> appeared <hi>not right in the ſight of God,</hi> S. <hi>Peter</hi> admoniſheth him to <hi>repent of that his Wickedneſs, and pray God, if perhaps the thoughts of his Heart might be forgiven him,</hi> Act. 8.13, 21, 22. But,</p>
               <p n="1">1. They to whom God forgives Sins muſt be real and unfeigned Penitents; ſuch as are ſenſible of their Sins, and the Deſert of them; ſuch as are humbled in their own eyes, yea ſo as to loath themſelves for their Iniquities; ſuch as have that <hi>Sorrow which is after God, that worketh Repentance not to be repented of.</hi> Such a Repentance as is not for <hi>ſome</hi> Sins onely, but for <hi>all;</hi> not onely for Sins <hi>open</hi> and notorious, but alſo for Sins <hi>ſecret,</hi> and known to themſelves and God alone; not onely for Sins of <hi>outward Action</hi> or <hi>Words,</hi> but alſo for Sins of <hi>Thought,</hi> of evil Concupiſcence; not onely for Sins of <hi>Commiſſion,</hi> but alſo for Sins of <hi>Omiſſion:</hi> and according to the degrees of them, with a proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable degree of Sorrow; ſo as to mourn much, where the Sin hath been very hainous, as <hi>David</hi>'s was. And that not onely by reaſon of the Affliction conſequent, Danger of Hell, or Infamy; but alſo for the Diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring of God, and the Offending of him, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as a ſevere Judge, but alſo an indulgent Father. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thee, thee onely, have I ſinned, and done this Evil
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:42122:74"/>in thy ſight,</hi> ſaith <hi>David,</hi> Pſalm 51.4. And, <hi>Father,</hi> (ſaith the prodigal Son, <hi>Luk.</hi> 15.21.) <hi>I have ſinned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Heaven, and in thy ſight, and am no more worthy to be called thy Son.</hi> Thus S. <hi>John Baptiſt preached the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm of Repentance for the Remiſſion of Sins,</hi> Mark 1.4. S. <hi>Peter,</hi> Act. 2.38. <hi>Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the Name of Jeſus Chriſt, for the Remiſſion of Sins.</hi> And, <hi>Repent, and be converted, that your Sins may be blotted out,</hi> Act. 3.19. To them that thus Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, there is Forgiveneſs of Sins, not to the Impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and unrelenting.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To Repentance muſt be joyned Confeſſion of Sin. <hi>If we ſay that we have no Sin, we deceive our ſelves, and the Truth is not in us. If we confeſs our Sins, God is faithfull and juſt to forgive us our Sins, and to cleanſe us from all <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrighteouſneſs. If we ſay that we have not ſinned, we make him a Liar, and his word is not in us,</hi> 1 Joh. 1.8, 9, 10. How full is the Scripture againſt all Self-juſtitiaries, <hi>Phariſees,</hi> Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, Votaries, <hi>Pelagians, Quakers,</hi> and other Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oniſts, that boaſt of their own Good works, and their being free from Sin? No marvel that they that think they have no need of Pardon, ſhould find none. God <hi>filleth the Hungry with good things: the Rich he ſendeth empty away.</hi> The proud <hi>Phariſee,</hi> that talked of his own Well-doings, the boaſting Papiſt, that is confident of his own good Merits from God, are not capable of Juſtification. It is the poor Publican, that is ſenſible of his Sin, that <hi>ſtands afar off,</hi> that <hi>will not lift up ſo much as his eyes to Heaven,</hi> as being dejected by the ſenſe of his Sins, but <hi>ſmites on his breaſt, ſaying, God be mercifull to me a Sinner,</hi> that <hi>goes home juſtified, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then the other;</hi> as <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf hath determined, <hi>Luk.</hi> 18.13, 14.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>When I kept ſilence, day and night</hi> (ſaith <hi>David</hi> to
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:42122:75" rendition="simple:additions"/>God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.3, 4, 5.) <hi>thy Hand was heavy upon me. I acknowledged my Sin unto thee, and mine Iniquity have I not hid. I ſaid, I will confeſs my Tranſgreſſion unto the Lord; and thou forgaveſt the Iniquity of my Sin.</hi> There was no neceſſity of Auricular Popiſh Confeſſion to a Prieſt; his purpoſe of doing it to God ſeriouſly, and with true Compunction and Contrition of Soul, was ſufficient for his Pardon. <hi>David</hi> ſaid unto <hi>Nathan, I have ſinned againſt the Lord:</hi> and <hi>Nathan,</hi> without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning him Penance for Satisfaction, tells him immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately, <hi>The Lord alſo hath put away thy Sin.</hi> A free and unfeigned Confeſſion of Sins to God never goes without Pardon, if it be with real Sorrow, and giving to God the Glory of his Juſtice: if other Qualifications be withall added, which are alſo to be conſidered; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the next and third is, That there be a Forſaking of the Sin in Heart and in Act.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That Sin that ſhall be pardoned muſt be hated, muſt be left. <hi>He that covereth his Sins ſhall not proſper: but whoſo confeſſeth and forſaketh them ſhall have Mercy, Prov.</hi> 28.13. While we love and cheriſh Sin, we bid defiance to God, and ſhew our ſelves Enemies to him, and therefore can expect no Favour from him: for <hi>he is not a God that hath pleaſure in Wickedneſs, neither ſhall Evil dwell with him,</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 5.4. For a man to ſay he is ſorry for his Sin, (as often men do,) and yet to commit it cuſtomarily again, is indeed to belie himſelf. True Sorrow would make men fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and wary how they fall into that, for which they ſay they are ſorry. <hi>Piſcator ictus ſapit:</hi> If they were ſenſible of the Evil of Sin, they would dread a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſe into it. And beſides, it is no better then a moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of God, to confeſs Sin, and pray him to forgive it, and yet to continue in the practice of it. It is all one as if thou ſhouldſt beg of God to give thee a Licence
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:42122:75"/>or Diſpenſation to ſin: as if thou ſhouldſt tell him, thou haſt ſinned indeed, but thou hopeſt he will not be angry, though thou doe ſo again: as if thou ſhouldſt ask of God, that he would make void his Law for thy ſake; let thee live as if thou owedſt no Subjection to him. It is to declare thy ſelf a profeſſed Rebell againſt him; to tell him, that <hi>he ſhall not rule over thee;</hi> and in effect to ſay, <hi>Depart from me, for I deſire not the knowledge of thy ways.</hi> Much more evil is it, when men harden themſelves againſt Reproof; hate him that deals plainly with them, becauſe he ſhews them the Sin which they will not leave; are Enemies to him that tells them the Truth; <hi>hate him that rebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth in the Gate, and abhorre him that ſpeaks uprightly, Amos</hi> 5.10. Such men are ſo far from obtaining Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, that they fall into <hi>Judas</hi> his Curſe, of <hi>adding In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iquity to Iniquity,</hi> and <hi>never come into God's Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,</hi> Pſal. 69.27.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That Sin may be forgiven, the chiefeſt Qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of all muſt not be omitted, Faith in the Lord <hi>Jeſus;</hi> who though he <hi>knew no Sin,</hi> yet was <hi>made Sin for us, that we might be made the Righteouſneſs of God in him,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.21. This is the tenour of the Goſpel, (as <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf inſtructed his Apoſtles,) that <hi>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and Remiſſion of Sins ſhould be preached in his Name among all Nations,</hi> Luk. 24.47. And according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly S. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith to <hi>Cornelius,</hi> Act. 10.43. <hi>To Chriſt give all the Prophets witneſs, that through his Name, whoſoever believeth in him ſhall receive Remiſſion of Sins.</hi> And S. <hi>Paul,</hi> Act. 13.38, 39. <hi>Be it known unto you therefore, men and brethren, that through this Man is preached un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you the Forgiveneſs of Sin: And by him all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve are juſtified from all things, from which ye could not be juſtified by the Law of Moſes.</hi> He <hi>was delivered for our Offences, and raiſed for our Juſtification,</hi> Rom. 4.25.
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:42122:76"/>
                  <hi>Chriſt died for our Sins, according to the Scriptures,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.3. <hi>He was wounded for our Tranſgreſſions, he was bruiſed for our Iniquities: the Chaſtiſement of our Peace was upon him, and with his Stripes we are healed. All we like Sheep have gone aſtray: we have turned every one to his own way, and the Lord hath laid on him the Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of us all,</hi> Iſa. 53.5, 6. <hi>His own ſelf bare our Sins in his own body on the Tree,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.24. Theſe and many more places in Holy Scripture do evince, that it is by the Death of <hi>Chriſt</hi> that our Sins are remitted. And the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.12. tells us, that <hi>after he had offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red one Sacrifice for Sins, he ſate down for ever at the right hand of God:</hi> and, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.24. that <hi>he is entred into heaven</hi> with his bloud, <hi>to appear for us in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God:</hi> and, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.14. that <hi>by one Offering he hath for ever perfected them that are ſanctified.</hi> And therefore they that reject that Sacrifice, and ſtick to the Law and its Prieſthood, miſs of Forgiveneſs of Sins. It is impoſſible now, without Faith in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> his Death, Reſurrection, and Interceſſion at God's right Hand, to be free from Condemnation, and to obtain Forgiveneſs. But Faith is ſufficient (without the Figment of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bloudy Propitiatory Sacrifice offered by a Prieſt in the Maſs) to expiate Sin, and to obtain Remiſſion. Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever therefore believes not that <hi>Chriſt is he that was to come,</hi> that doth not believe and truſt to his Bloud and Interceſſion for Forgiveneſs with God, that truſts in the Sacrifice of the Maſs, the Milk of the Virgin <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> the Mediation of Saints, or any other thing beſides <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Death and Interceſſion, that man forfeits his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in God's Pardoning Grace.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That Sin may be forgiven, there muſt be a Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the Lord. <hi>Let the wicked forſake his ways, and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord, and he will have mercy on him; and to our
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:42122:76"/>God, for he will abundantly pardon,</hi> ſaith the Prophet <hi>Iſa.</hi> (55.7.) <hi>Wherefore doth a living man complain, a man for the puniſhment of his Sins?</hi> ſaith <hi>Jeremy,</hi> Lament. 3.39. and directs him the beſt courſe, <hi>Let us ſearch and try our ways, and turn again to the Lord,</hi> verſ. 40. And that is to be done,</p>
               <p n="1">1. By humble Supplication; <hi>Ibid.</hi> v. 41. <hi>Let us lift up our heart with our hands unto God in the Heavens;</hi> by Praying for it, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.12. by juſtifying God, condemning our ſelves; taking Shame to our ſelves, and acquitting God from all blame; deprecating his Severity, imploring his Mercy for his Son's ſake, whom <hi>God ſending in the likeneſs of ſinfull fleſh, hath condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Sin in the fleſh:</hi> and <hi>therefore there is no Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to them that are in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> Rom. 8.1, 3.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But then muſt be added the ſecond thing, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we turn to God, to wit, Newneſs of life: <hi>There is no Condemnation to them that are in Chriſt Jeſus, who walk not after the fleſh, but after the Spirit. Waſh ye, make ye clean, put away the Evil of your doings from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mine eyes, ceaſe to doe evil, learn to doe well; ſeek Judgment, relieve the oppreſſed, judge the fatherleſs, plead for the widows:</hi> and then, ſaith God, <hi>Come now, and let us reaſon together: Though your Sins be as Scarlet, they ſhall be as white as Snow; though they be red like Crimſon, they ſhall be as Wooll,</hi> Iſa. 1.16, 17, 18. It is not the plea of Innocency that prevails with God, but the earneſt Supplication for Mercy: not the Tale of a vain-glorious <hi>Phariſee,</hi> but the feeling Prayer of a broken-hearted Publican, that obtains Forgiveneſs. Nor will he that <hi>hath eſcaped the Pollutions of the world through the knowledge of Chriſt</hi> be ſafe, if with <hi>the Dog</hi> he <hi>return to his vomit, and the Sow that was waſhed, to her wallowing in the mire.</hi> He that ſins again, ſins more dangerouſly: as he that falls into a Relapſe is more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperately
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:42122:77" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſick. New Obedience is neceſſary to aſſure the Forgiveneſs of old Sins.</p>
               <p n="6">6. There is yet another Qualification neceſſary to the Forgiveneſs of our own Sins, that we forgive other mens Sins againſt our ſelves. Our Saviour puts it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord's Prayer, that we ſhould profeſs to God <hi>our Forgiveneſs of them that are indebted to us,</hi> as a Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why we expect Forgiveneſs of him when we pray him to <hi>forgive us.</hi> Yea he allows us not to ask Forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God, but according <hi>as we forgive</hi> others. <hi>If you forgive men their Treſpaſſes, your Heavenly Father will alſo forgive you. But if ye forgive not men their Treſpaſſes, neither will your Father forgive your Treſpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> Matth. 6.14, 15. Yea, in the cloſe of that Parable, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.35. he tells us, that our heavenly Father will exact our Debts, caſt us into Priſon, deliver us to the Tormentours, <hi>if we from our hearts forgive not every one his Brother their Treſpaſſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He that bears a Grudge, that reſerves a purpoſe of Revenge in his breaſt, that ſaies he will forgive, but not forget, that paſſeth not an Act of Indemnity and Oblivion of his Brother's Injuries, doth but delude God, play the Hypocrite with him, when he prays the Lord's Prayer; ſhews himſelf to be unlike to God; of a venomous, Toad-like, Viper-like nature, malicious like Satan; and ſo doth the more provoke and enrage God againſt him, as being an unthankfull, virulent, Devilliſh Wretch, that deals ſo unworthily with him, and abuſeth him to his face. And this uſhers in the laſt thing I am to conſider, to wit,</p>
               <p n="4">IV. Why there is Forgiveneſs with God.</p>
               <p>Of many Reaſons I ſhall name one or two, beſides that in my Text.</p>
               <p n="1">1. From his Property of Mercifulneſs. He <hi>is very pitifull, and of tender Mercy,</hi> Jam. 5.11. He is not like
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:42122:77"/>a cruel Tyrant, that delights to deſtroy; but like a gracious King, that is glad to ſave.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Eſt piger ad poenam Princeps, ad praemia velox:</l>
                  <l>Quique dolet quoties cogitur eſſe ferox.</l>
               </q>
               <p>It is for a <hi>Sicilian</hi> Tyrant, to invent Torments; or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for a Fiend of Hell, to rejoyce in doing hurt. <hi>I am the Lord which exerciſe Loving-kindneſs, Judgment and Righteouſneſs in the Earth; for in theſe things I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, ſaith the Lord,</hi> Jer. 9.24. <hi>Who is a God like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee,</hi> (ſaith the Prophet <hi>Micah,</hi> 7.18, 19.) <hi>that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doneth Iniquity, and paſſeth by the Tranſgreſſion of the remnant of his Heritage? he retaineth not his Anger for ever, becauſe he delighteth in Mercy. He will turn again, he will have Compaſſion on us, he will ſubdue our Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: and thou wilt caſt all their Sins into the depth of the Sea.</hi> And then the Prophet adds, verſ. 20. that which is my Second Reaſon why God forgives,</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Thou wilt perform the Truth to Jacob, and the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to Abraham, which thou haſt ſworn unto our Fathers from the days of old.</hi> This is the Reaſon why he hath <hi>raiſed up a Horn of Salvation,</hi> and <hi>gives the knowledge of Salvation for</hi> or <hi>by the Remiſſion of Sins: to perform the Mercy promiſed to our Fathers, and to remember his holy Covenant, the Oath which he ſware to our Father Abraham,</hi> Luk. 1.69, 72, 73, 77. And for this Reaſon the Bloud of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is termed by himſelf, <hi>the bloud of the New Teſtament, which is ſhed for many for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of Sins,</hi> Matth. 26.28. And the Covenant of God is alleged as witneſſing the effect of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, wherein God ſaid, <hi>Their Sins and Iniquities will I remember no more,</hi> Heb. 10.16, 17.

               <p>
                  <hi>That God's Forgiveneſs engageth and encourageth men to fear him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is objected againſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> Jer. 5.23, 24. that they had <hi>a revolting and a rebellious Heart,</hi> becauſe <hi>they ſaid not in their hearts, Let us now fear the Lord our God, that giveth Rain, both the former and the latter in his ſeaſon: he reſerveth unto us the appointed weeks of the Harveſt.</hi> Which evinceth this to be an Evil, That men fear not God notwithſtanding his Providences to them for good: and therefore God's Care of us ſhould engage us to fear him. And it is propheſied, that <hi>the Children of Iſrael ſhall return, and ſeek the Lord their God, and David their King, and ſhall fear the Lord and his Goodneſs in the latter days,</hi> Hoſ. 3.5. Which intimates, that God's Goodneſs is to be feared; and that it is both an engagement and encouragement to fear him, that he is good. <hi>O fear the Lord, ye his Saints: for there is no want to them that fear him,</hi> Pſal. 34.9.</p>
               <p>Now of all parts of his Goodneſs, this is the chief, his Forgiving Sins. It is that which ſhews the greateſt Kindneſs and Condeſcenſion in God. Therefore when <hi>David</hi> bleſſeth God, he puts this in the firſt place; <hi>Bleſs the Lord, O my Soul, and forget not all his Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, Who forgiveth all thine Iniquities,</hi> Pſal. 103.2, 3. And it is the greateſt Bleſſing to us. <hi>Bleſſed is he whoſe Tranſgreſſion is forgiven, and whoſe Sin is covered. Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed is the man unto whom the Lord imputeth not Iniquity, Pſal.</hi> 32.1, 2. This Favour then requires Fear in the
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:42122:78"/>greateſt degree. Not a tormenting Fear, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth not with Love, and which is <hi>expelled by Love,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.18. ſuch as is in <hi>Devils,</hi> that <hi>fear and tremble, Jam.</hi> 2.19. but a dutifull Fear, which makes us wary how we offend God, and ſtudious how to pleaſe him: makes us fear him, not as an Enemy or Tyrant, from whom we expect nothing but hard Uſage and ſore Tasks; but as a good Maſter, or a loving Father, whom we fear as our Superiour, that may puniſh us, yet love for his Goodneſs, Bounty, and Indulgence to us. This Fear is uſually termed a <hi>filial</hi> or reverentiall <hi>Fear:</hi> which is manifeſted, 1. in our Worſhip of him <hi>with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence and godly fear,</hi> Heb. 12.28. where the Fear of God is put for his Worſhip, as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 29.13. 2. in our Obedience to him, both active, in doing his Will, and paſſive, in ſubmitting to his Correction. Now to this Fear God's Forgiveneſs engageth us,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe ſuch Forgiveneſs ſhould and doth beget Love. To whom <hi>many Sins were forgiven, ſhe loved much,</hi> ſaith <hi>Chriſt,</hi> Luk. 7.47. What Rebel is ſo hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted, as not to love his Prince, that hath forgiven his manifold Treaſons? We have been more treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to God, and yet he forgives us; and ſhall we not then love him, and fear to offend him?</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is no greater Security can be given to draw our Hearts to God, then the Forgiveneſs of Sins. This is that <hi>Loving-kindneſs</hi> that <hi>draws us to God,</hi> Jer. 31.3. <hi>the Chords of a man, the Bands of Love,</hi> that tie us faſt to God, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 11.4. And therefore there is no more expedite, more rationall, more ſure way to maintain perpetuall Amity between us and God, to devote us to his Service, to bring us into Communion with him, then the Preaching and Believing the rich Grace of the Goſpel in the Remiſſion of Sins by <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt,</hi> according to the New Covenant in his
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:42122:79" rendition="simple:additions"/>Bloud. But I ſee the time will not permit me to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large on this precious Subject: I ſhall now apply that which hath been ſaid in ſome neceſſary Uſes, and ſo end.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="application">
               <head>APPLICATION.</head>
               <p n="1">1. Firſt then, If there be Forgiveneſs with God, and that of the greateſt Sins, let no drooping Soul ſink un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſenſe of his Sins: though they have been Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let or Crimſon Sins, yet there is Pardon to be had.</p>
               <p>It is true, (as now-a-days things go,) the greateſt Sinners are moſt hardened in Security: there is an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſtical Spirit, that makes men bold in Sinning. Whether it be from the ſubtle Inſinuations of ſome Seducers, who (like <hi>Balaam</hi> of old) inſtill into mens minds thoſe Principles which make them as audacious as <hi>Zimri</hi> and <hi>Cozbi</hi> of old were, ſo that they <hi>declare their Sins as Sodom, and hide them not; ungodly men crept in</hi> among us, <hi>turning the Grace of God into wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſs:</hi> or from their doting ſo much on Nature, as they call it, that they forget the God of Nature; ſo magnifying <hi>Naturam naturatam,</hi> that they heed not <hi>Naturam naturantem,</hi> as they barbarouſly ſpeak in the Schools: or that the Miſcarriages of hypocriticall Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſours of Religion induce them to think all Zeal in Religion is but from Fancy, not God's Spirit; and that all zealous perſons are Fanaticks, or men not in their right wits, not ſoberly wiſe.</p>
               <p>So it is, that the greateſt part either openly commit the moſt horrid Sins; monſtrouſly Swearing, as if they would dare God to his face, Scoffing at the practice of Piety, making no ſcruple of Deceiving, ſpending their time in Drinking, prodigally waſting their Eſtates by Luxury and the like, which ſhould be imployed
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:42122:79"/>to good Uſes, for the Relief of others, and the publick benefit: or they ſecretly practiſe ſome or all theſe Sins (or worſe, if it may be) under Diſguiſes of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and other Vizors without Fear. They that complain moſt of Sin, are uſually they that are moſt fearfull of Sin.</p>
               <p>Yet to both it is needfull this Doctrine be taught, of God's Forgiveneſs. The moſt hardened <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> may be <hi>taken in the Thorns,</hi> and humbled: the moſt audacious Sinner among you may be awakened, and his Eyes opened, to <hi>ſee how evil and bitter a thing it is that he hath ſinned againſt the Lord, and his Fear hath not been in him:</hi> Poverty, Impriſonment, Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or Death approaching, may <hi>open his Ears to Diſcipline,</hi> and make him remember God. If theſe things happen, let him remember (though but then) that there is Forgiveneſs with God. And for any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perplexed perſon, let him never forget to have this Cordial in the Cloſet of his Heart, which may revive him in his Agonies and Faintings of ſpirit, That there is Forgiveneſs with the Lord. But then,</p>
               <p n="2">2. Let them not forget how and by what means it is obtained, to wit, by Repentance, Confeſſion, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking of Sin, Faith in <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s bloud, humble Suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to God, new Obedience to him, and Forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our Brother. There muſt be another Heart, <hi>a heart of Fleſh,</hi> not <hi>a heart of Stone,</hi> in him that ſhall obtain Forgiveneſs. <hi>He ſhall have Judgment with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Mercy that ſhews no Mercy.</hi> You muſt take heed of ſeeking Forgiveneſs by Popes or Prieſts ſuppoſed power to forgive Sins by their Authority, by others of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiating for you; or by your own Satisfactions, Works of Penance, Faſting, Alms, or other laborious Works impoſed, or undertaken by your ſelves, as meriting or procuring your Abſolution. But you muſt wholly
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:42122:80"/>rely on the Death and Interceſſion of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and the Covenant in his Bloud. Though in the mean time you are not to omit other Duties, which I have ſhewed to be required of God in their place.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Be ſure not to forget to magnifie the Grace of God, with whom is Forgiveneſs. Stand and admire that infinite Goodneſs, that after all the Sins of thy Progenitours, (<hi>Adam</hi>'s Sin in Revolting from God his Maker and Benefactour, the Sins of thy Pagan Anceſtours in their horrid Idolatries and other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations, the Sins of thy Popiſh Anceſtours in their perverting the Goſpell of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> imitating the Vices and Superſtitions of Pagans, corrupting Chriſtianity, and deſtroying Myriads of holy Souls, who in their Generations oppoſed their Abominations, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for the Truth of <hi>Chriſt,</hi>) beſides thy own Sins of Idleneſs, Pride, Wantonneſs, Envy, Covetouſneſs, Ungodlineſs, Profaning holy things, living <hi>without God in the world,</hi> he ſhould yet have Mercy on thee, pardon thy Sins, and ſave thy Soul. Oh ſay with <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, Bleſs the Lord, O my Soul, and all that is within me bleſs his holy Name,</hi> Pſal. 103.1.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Forget not to fear him for the time to come. It is the End of his Forgiving, that thou ſhouldſt fear him. If God miſs his End, thou wilt loſe thy hopes of Forgiveneſs. Mark what our Saviour ſaith, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.14. <hi>Behold, thou art made whole; ſin no more, leſt a worſe thing happen unto thee. Surely,</hi> ſaith <hi>Elihu, Job</hi> 34.31, 32. <hi>it is meet to be ſaid unto God, I will not offend any more. That which I ſee not, teach thou me: if I have done Iniquity, I will doe no more.</hi> If par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning Grace do not better thee, it will leave thee more inexcuſable, and thy Damnation more certain and juſt. If thou become not obſequious to God, and mercifull to others, thy Pardon will be null'd.</p>
               <pb n="151" facs="tcp:42122:80"/>
               <p>Oh do not forfeit thy Pardon by After-diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: but as thou haſt God to remember thee in Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, be ſure to remember him by Dutifulneſs to him all thy days. That when thou ſhalt meet with thy Father in Heaven, thou maiſt be raviſh'd with his Grace, and he may welcome thee as his obedient Son into his everlaſting Joy. <hi>Amen.</hi>

            <p>Hitherto are we led by this Precedent which I have read to you, <hi>O remember not againſt us,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The Argument of the Pſalm ſufficiently intimates the Time and the Occaſion of penning it. The firſt Verſe being a Complaint to God, that <hi>the Heathen were come into God's Inheritance,</hi> that is, the Land of <hi>Judaea,</hi> had <hi>defiled</hi> or <hi>profaned his holy Temple,</hi> by caſting it to the ground, and had <hi>laid Jeruſalem on heaps.</hi> Which was done by none but <hi>Chaldaeans,</hi> when this Pſalm was compoſed: and therefore it was compoſed after, and upon occaſion of the Demolition and Conflagration of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Temple by <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>'s appointment, of which we reade <hi>Jer.</hi> 52. which moved either <hi>Ezra,</hi> or <hi>Daniel,</hi> or ſome other Holy perſon of that Time, to addreſs himſelf to God with Complaint, Expoſtulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Petition, in the words of my Text, <hi>O remember not againſt us,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Wherein are,</p>
            <p n="1">1. A Deprecation, <hi>O remember not,</hi> &amp;c. By <hi>former Iniquities</hi> ſome underſtand their Idolatry in making the Golden Calf in the Wilderneſs: concerning which the <hi>Jews</hi> have a Tradition, That in all the Miſeries which came upon that People, there was ſome Remembrance of that Sin; according to that which is ſaid in <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.34. <hi>Nevertheleſs, in the Day when I ſhall viſit, I will viſit their Sin upon them.</hi> But more probably are meant the Sins of <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> and other Kings, whereby they polluted the Temple with Heatheniſh Abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>filled Jeruſalem with bloud,</hi> brake their Oath to <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> were obſtinate againſt all the War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of the Prophets, whom <hi>they mocked, deſpiſing their words, and miſuſing their perſons;</hi> which <hi>ſtirred up the Wrath of God againſt his people, ſo as there was no Remedy,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36.16. Theſe were the Sins that <hi>Daniel</hi> meant in his Supplication, which either ſymbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:42122:82"/>or was contemporary with this, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.5, 6. Now God is ſaid to <hi>remember</hi> Sins, when he doth actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally puniſh perſons for them; and this is deprecated here: ſimple Forgetfulneſs being a thing impoſſible to befall God, who is uncapable of any defect, but hath all things, paſt, preſent, and to come, in his view through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all Eternity.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Here is a Petition for Help, <hi>Let thy tender Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies ſpeedily prevent us.</hi> Wherein the thing deſired is, the coming of Aid for their Deliverance from their Captivity, and the reſtoring of their City and Temple; and that to be haſtened, the time ſeeming long to them, in which they were oppreſſed by the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Kings, and kept from the Land of their deſires. And this is begged as a product of God's <hi>tender Mercies,</hi> or <hi>Bowels of Mercies:</hi> by which Expreſſion ſuch Mercy as is wont to be in Mothers towards the Children of their womb, whoſe Bowells earn towards them, is attributed to God. Though, to ſpeak exactly, (as the Schoolmen ſay,) Mercy is not in God <hi>ſecundùm Affectum,</hi> he hath not any formal Dolour or Sympathy, ſo as to be grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with our Evills, as we are when we pity others; but <hi>ſecundùm Effectum,</hi> in reſpect of the Effect, becauſe God in our Miſery doth (as we doe when we have Compaſſion on others) afford Succour and Relief to thoſe whom he is ſaid to be mercifull to.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Petition is enforced with the mention of their low Condition; <hi>For we are brought very low, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poveriſhed,</hi> or <hi>made thin:</hi> that is, we are poor in Purſe, thin of People, much diminiſhed every way, ſpoiled, debarred of our Liberty, of our Religion, of our Peace, burthened with imperious Commands, heavy Yokes of the Lordly Tyrants of <hi>Babylon,</hi> perſecuted with a fiery Furnace for not adoring their Idol, in danger of caſting into a Den of Lions for calling upon the Name of our

               <p>Conſonant hereto are God's Declarations of himſelf. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 59.1, 2. <hi>Behold, the Lord's Hand is not ſhortned, that it cannot ſave: neither is his Ear heavy, that it cannot hear. But your Iniquities have ſeparated between you and your God: and your Sins have hid his Face from you. Perditio tua ex te, Iſrael: O Iſrael, thou haſt deſtroyed thy ſelf,</hi> Hoſ. 13.9. <hi>Your Iniquities have turned away theſe things, and your Sins have withholden good things from you,</hi> Jer. 5.25.</p>
               <p>We may then thank our ſelves for all the Evils that come upon us: we muſt not caſt them upon Deſtiny, Stars, or any other Cauſe, and leave out the principal Cauſe, which is <hi>the plague of our own hearts.</hi> God is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Authour of Sin, nor the Puniſher of Sin without
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:42122:84"/>cauſe. It is the Devil's property, to rejoyce in Evil: and therefore as he tempts to Sin, ſo he delights to tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. It is otherwiſe with God: Afflictions are <hi>Opus alienum, his ſtrange work. He doth not afflict willingly, nor grieve the children of men, To cruſh under his feet all the priſoners of the earth,</hi> Lament. 3.33, 34. <hi>Is God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous, who taketh Vengeance? (I ſpeak as a man:) God forbid; for then how ſhall God judge the world?</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.5, 6.</p>
               <p>We deny not, that God might impoſe Sufferings on him that had no Sin of himſelf: <hi>He made</hi> his Son <hi>to be Sin for us, who knew no Sin,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. <hi>Job</hi>'s Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties came on him by God's Permiſſion, though he were <hi>an upright man, one that feared God, and eſchewed Evil, Job</hi> 1.8. that he might prove his Integrity by his great Patience. Of the Son who was born blind <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaith, <hi>Joh.</hi> 9.3. <hi>Neither hath this man ſinned, nor his Parents:</hi> that is, there was no ſpecial Sin committed by either of them, (as his Diſciples deemed,) which was the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate cauſe of his Blindneſs; but it came to paſs, <hi>that the works of God ſhould be made manifeſt in him.</hi> The Holy Martyrs <hi>ſuffered for Righteouſneſs ſake,</hi> and were therefore to <hi>count it all Joy when they fell into manifold Temptations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But in ſuch Evils as their Circumſtances demonſtrate to be from a more then common Hand of God, ſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when they are publick and univerſal, as we are to acknowledge the Finger of God in them; ſo we are to diſcern them to be <hi>the fruit of our doings, and the work of our hands.</hi> The Scripture ſtyles them God's Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and <hi>we are ſure</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.2.) <hi>that the Judgment of God is according to truth againſt them that commit ſuch things.</hi> And therefore, though we are not allowed to judge of the afflicted as greater Sinners then others, and point out them as the Cauſes
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:42122:85"/>of common Calamities; yet we are to judge our ſelves, and impute the Evil, what-ever it be, to our own Sins. <hi>Moſes, the man of God,</hi> in the 109. Pſalm, which was made in a time of great Mortality, (ſuch as is now with us,) having ſaid to God, verſ. 7. <hi>We are conſumed by thine Anger, and by thy Wrath we are troubled;</hi> addes, verſ. 8. <hi>Thou haſt ſet our Iniquities before thee, and our ſecret Sins in the light of thy countenance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is true, that <hi>all</hi> outward <hi>things happen alike to all; there is,</hi> in publick Calamities eſpecially, <hi>one event to the Righteous and to the Wicked: No man knoweth love or hatred by all that is before him,</hi> Eccles. 9.1, 2. Yet even in theſe, and all other, that of the Prophet, <hi>Lament.</hi> 3.39, 40. is neceſſary for every perſon to mind: <hi>Wherefore doth a living man complain, a man for the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of his Sins? Let us ſearch and try our ways, and turn again unto the Lord.</hi> Though in this day of God's Viſitation we may diſcern many common and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen Sins, the increaſe of which may be judged the Cauſe wherefore God brings this ſore Scourge of the Peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, in ſuch a manner, at ſuch a time, in thoſe places on which it lights, conſidering that God ſhoots not at Rovers, but at a certain Mark; (and ſo the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Practices of the Perſons and Places may juſtly lead us to determine, that ſuch Sins as have been by them and there committed are the Sins God puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth, for inſtance, the Uncleanneſs, Riot, Profaneneſs, and other Sins committed among us, have brought down this Vengeance on our great City:) yet ſince there are particular Sins alſo with us, and there is never a one of us but hath his ſecret Sins, (perhaps our Securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, putting far from us the Evil day, living in Eaſe and Pleaſure, Unmercifulneſs, and Inſenſibleneſs of the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions of others, ſecret Atheiſm, Lukewarmneſs in Religion, leaving our firſt Love, Backſliding from our

               <p>
                  <hi>That the Removing of the Calamities which are inflicted by God, when he remembers mens Sins, is the effect of God's tender Mercies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So it is expreſly ſaid, <hi>Lament.</hi> 3.22, 23. <hi>It is of the Lord's Mercies that we are not conſumed, becauſe his Compaſſions fail not. They are new every morning: great is thy Faithfulneſs.</hi> Verſ. 32. <hi>Though he cauſe Grief, yet will he have Compaſſion according to the multitude of his Mercies.</hi> And hereto accord very many ſpeeches of God concerning himſelf: That he is <hi>the Lord, the Lord God, mercifull and gracious, long-ſuffering, and abundant in Goodneſs and Truth, keeping Mercy for thouſands, forgiving Iniquity, Tranſgreſſion and Sin;</hi> as he ſays in his ſolemn Proclamation to <hi>Moſes,</hi> Exod. 34.6, 7. <hi>Who is a God like unto thee, that pardoneth Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, and paſſeth by the Tranſgreſſion of the Remnant of his Heritage? He retaineth not his Anger for ever, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he delighteth in mercy,</hi> Mic. 7.18.</p>
               <p>Hence it is that the Holy Writers, and all the Saints, do ſtill celebrate his Mercies, as being <hi>tender, abundant, free, rejoycing againſt Judgment:</hi> and, to inſtance in no other, there is a whole Pſalm, (136.) in which the cloſe of every verſe is this, <hi>For his Mercy endureth for
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:42122:86"/>ever.</hi> And this Mercy of his is the Reaſon of all thoſe works of Goodneſs he doeth, as to the World in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, in <hi>cauſing his Sun to riſe on the Juſt and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>njuſt,</hi> and being <hi>kind to the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nthankfull and to the Evil, Luk.</hi> 6.35. ſo as that <hi>his tender Mercies are over all his works,</hi> Pſal. 145.9. ſo chiefly to his own people, all whoſe Deliverances and Benefits are made the fruits of his Mercy. Above all, the great Redemption in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> of which the Apoſtle thus ſpeaks, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.4, 5. <hi>God who is rich in Mercy, out of the great Love where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he hath loved us, even when we were dead in Sins, hath quickned us together with Chriſt,</hi> is the effect of the higheſt, moſt tranſcendent and everlaſting Mercy. Hence in all their Praiſes, the Godly remember his Mercies: as the Prophet <hi>Iſa.</hi> (63.7.) <hi>I will mention the Loving-kindneſs of the Lord, and the Praiſes of the Lord, according to all that the Lord hath beſtowed on us; and the great Goodneſs towards the houſe of Iſrael, which he hath beſtowed on them, according to his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and according to the multitude of his Loving-kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In like manner, their Obſecrations are <hi>by the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of God,</hi> Rom. 12.1. as of all things moſt dear to them: and their Prayers are ſtill enforced by minding God of his Mercies. So in the Penitentiall Pſalms: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 6.2. <hi>Have Mercy upon me, O Lord, for I am weak;</hi> verſ. 4. <hi>Return, O Lord, deliver my Soul, O ſave me for thy Mercy's ſake;</hi> Pſal. 51.1. <hi>Have Mercy upon me, O God, according to thy Loving-kindneſs: accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the multitude of thy tender Mercies, blot out my Tranſgreſſions;</hi> and ſo in the reſt. There is ſcarce a Pſalm of Petition, or Thankſgiving, or Narration of God's Acts, but there is ſome, if not frequent, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God's Mercy and tender Compaſſion, as the Source of all the Help his people have, and the
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:42122:86"/>Ground of their Hope for what they want. And the Reaſons hereof are,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe without God's Mercy there would be no Forgiveneſs of Sin, and without Forgiveneſs of Sin there would be no Deliverance from Evil. Where the Holy Scripture mentions Redemption from Evil, it aſcribes it to the Forgiveneſs of Sin. The <hi>Redemption in Chriſt</hi> is in <hi>the Forgiveneſs of Sins,</hi> Eph. 1.7. <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving of Sins</hi> and <hi>Healing Diſeaſes</hi> are conjoyned <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.3. And Forgiving of Sins is derived from Mercy: He <hi>pardoneth Iniquity, becauſe he delighteth in Mercy,</hi> Mich. 7.18. <hi>Of his own Mercy he ſaved us,</hi> Tit. 3.5. Therefore <hi>à primo ad ultimum,</hi> thoſe follow one another; Redemption from Evil follows Forgiveneſs of Sins, and Forgiveneſs of Sins God's tender Mercies. And therefore it is God's tender Mercy that Evils are removed, as taking away the Cauſe, whereupon the Effect ceaſeth.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But farther, All Influx of Good is from God's tender Mercy. There is nothing that doth or can make God a Debtor to any, but his tender Mercy. Man is a poor helpleſs thing of himſelf: the beſt of men, in their eſtate antecedent to God's Help, are more deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of power to help themſelves then the very Brutes; whether in reſpect of Naturals, or Spiritualls. As we are born into the world, we are, as God ſaid of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> Ezek. 16.6. as a young Child <hi>expoſed, pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted in our own bloud;</hi> without the Mercy of God teaching, ſtrengthening, and providing for us, certain to periſh. There is <hi>none eye that pities us,</hi> to doe us any good, without God. It is his Mercy that the Sun ſhineth on us, that the Air refreſheth us, our Food nouriſheth us, our Cloaths warm us; that we have Strength to act, Wiſedom to direct us. It is his Mercy that our Parents take care of us, that our Friends com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:42122:87"/>us, our Enemies pity us, Devils are curbed from hurting us, Miniſters preach to us the way of Life, the Holy Angels aſſiſt us, the Spirit of God guides us, and, which is the Mercy of Mercies, that the Son of God is given for us and to us, and <hi>with him all things:</hi> and ſo he crowns us with Loving-kindneſs and tender Mercies. In a word, all the Safety and Benefits we enjoy, which are innumerable, are Fruits ſpringing from the tender Mercies of God as the Root. Mercy is the Principle which ſets God on work to doe all the good he doeth. This is evidenced from the</p>

                  <hi>He makes the low Condition of Supplicants his Seaſon of miniſtring Help.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is acknowledged <hi>Pſal.</hi> 136.23. <hi>Who remembred us in our low eſtate; for his Mercy endureth for ever.</hi> In another Pſalm (107.) throughout, this way of God's Providence is exemplified in his dealing with Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims, Priſoners, Captives, Diſeaſed perſons, Mariners, oppreſſed Subjects; to all which, and all other ſorts of dejected and diſconſolate perſons, when their Caſe is deplorable, when they are deſtitute of all other Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, when all things are dark and cloudy about them, when they are reduced to extremities, and <hi>are at their wits end,</hi> God ſteps in, and by ſome way unthought of, unexpected, miniſters ſeaſonable ſupply, timely Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour and Relief. The Scripture is full of Inſtances, in the caſe of <hi>Jacob, David, Jonah, Paul,</hi> and many others. Beſides the famous Inſtances of old, of Rain ſent to <hi>Antoninus</hi> his Army upon the Prayers of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; of Help to <hi>Conſtantine</hi> againſt <hi>Maxentius,</hi> to <hi>Theodoſius</hi> againſt <hi>Eugenius:</hi> and of late, our own great Deliverances, from the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Invaſion in Eighty eight,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:42122:87"/>of the King and Parliament from the Gunpowder-Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; and, which is moſt appoſite to the preſent ſtate of things, the Deliverance of our Metropolis from the ſweeping Peſtilence in the memory of many of us. Theſe and innumerable more Experiences (of which no conſiderate Chriſtian that hath been at Death's door, or under Agony of Spirit, or in any other low Eſtate, wants Inſtances,) do abundantly prove this Truth, That <hi>Man's Extremity is God's Opportunity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the Reaſon is, Becauſe then Mercy appears to be Mercy; God is then manifeſted to be what he is ſtyled to be, <hi>the Father of Mercies, and the God of all Conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.3. As the Devil then appears to be a Devil, when he takes advantage of our Weakneſs, to hurt us: ſo God appears to be God, by making our Infirmity the Reaſon of his Help. Thereby he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courageth us to truſt in him, engageth us to Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, and to Obedience. That is the Harveſt-time, when God reaps moſt Glory; and we <hi>carry home with Joy,</hi> after our <hi>Mourning, our Sheaves</hi> of Aſſurance of his Salvation. S. <hi>Paul</hi> therefore tells us, that in his <hi>Trouble in Aſia,</hi> he was <hi>preſſed out of meaſure, above ſtrength, inſomuch that he deſpaired even of life, had the ſentence of death in himſelf,</hi> to this end, <hi>that he ſhould not truſt in himſelf, but in God which raiſeth the dead:</hi> and then <hi>God delivered him from ſo great a death, and did ſtill deliver him, and</hi> therefore <hi>he truſted that he would yet deliver him,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.8, 9, 10. Such ſeaſonable Help in Extremities God would therefore have obſerved, and kept upon Record, and always ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were commanded to preſent their basket of Firſt-fruits, and to make this Confeſſion ſolemnly, <hi>Deut.</hi> 26.5, &amp;c. <hi>A Syrian ready to periſh was my Father, and he went down into Egypt, and ſojourned

And the Egyptians evil intreated us, and afflicted us, and laid upon us hard Burthens. And when we cried unto the Lord God of our Fathers, the Lord heard our voice, and looked on our Affliction, and our Labour, and our Oppreſſion, and brought us thence into this place.</hi> Such Providences of God he requires us to <hi>obſerve,</hi> that we may <hi>underſtand his Loving-kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> Pſal. 107.43. that we may be excited to <hi>cry unto the Lord in our Trouble,</hi> who <hi>delivereth us out of our Diſtreſs.</hi> Which brings us to the</p>

                  <hi>That Bewailing of Sins, and humble and inſtant Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, are the proper and effectuall Remedies againſt the Calamities incumbent on God's people.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hereunto we are directed <hi>Lament.</hi> 3.40, 41, 42. <hi>Let us ſearch and try our ways, and turn again unto the Lord. Let us lift up our heart with our hands unto God in the Heavens. We have tranſgreſſed and have rebelled; thou haſt not pardoned.</hi> Thus did <hi>David,</hi> when God ſent a Plague on <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and ſwept away 700000, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 21.16, 17. <hi>He and the Elders of Iſrael, cloathed in Sackcloath, fell on their faces,</hi> confeſſed the Sin which was the Cauſe of it, prayed God to remove the Peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; and he was intreated of them. When there was a Plague upon <hi>Iſrael</hi> for their Murmuring, <hi>Aaron took Incenſe, and made an Atonement for the people: and he ſtood between the living and the dead; and the Plague was ſtayed,</hi> Num. 16.47, 48. At another time, when the <hi>Iſraelites provoked God to Anger with their Inventions, and the Plague brake in upon them, Phineas ſtood up, and executed Judgment,</hi> or prayed; <hi>and the Plague was ſtayed,</hi> Pſal. 106.29, 30.</p>
               <pb n="167" facs="tcp:42122:88"/>
               <p>This Antidote hath in all Ages been found a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervative againſt the Plague, and the moſt effectual Medicine to cure it. Phyſicians preſcribe many good Receipts: and Magiſtrates doe well, to uſe all the beſt means they can to hinder the ſpreading of Infection: and juſtly are thoſe deſtroyed as Peſts of Mankind, who willingly infect the ſound, or careleſly permit thoſe things which may poiſon others. They that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercifull to the Sick, ſuffering or cauſing them to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh by their negligence and ill uſage, are juſtly cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured as Promoters of the Contagion. But the truly Penitent, who confeſſeth and forſaketh his Sins, the importunate believing Petitioner at the Throne of Grace, the zealous and impartiall Magiſtrate, who exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuteth Judgment againſt thoſe venomous Sins that provoke God to ſhoot his deadly Arrows againſt us, are the beſt and moſt prevalent Inſtruments to cure the Plague, and to reſtore Health in our dwellings. On the other ſide, the unchaſt, intemperate, unrighteous, covetous Worldlings; the Atheiſtical, proud, profane, the deceitful Hypocrites, that are impenitent, that confeſs not their Sins, nor forſake their evil ways; thoſe that hang down their heads for a day, forbear a Meal or two, and perhaps come to hear, but are not affected with God's Hand, nor ſenſible of the Evil of their ways, that reform not their ungodly and unrighteous Life, that uſe other means to preſerve them, but ſeek not to God in good earneſt for Pardon of Sins, that appear here for company, but do not execute Juſtice, nor ſhew Mercy to others; Theſe are ſo far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inſtrumentall to removing the Plague, that they rather cauſe the continuance and the increaſe of it: it being God's courſe, <hi>not to turn away his Anger, but to ſtretch out his Hand ſtill</hi> in puniſhing, when <hi>people turn not to him that ſmiteth them, nor ſeek the Lord of hoaſts, Iſa.</hi> 9.12, 13.</p>

               <p>And now to apply what hath been ſaid to the preſent work. What the Preachers of God's Word have often foretold us, that for the Sins of this Land, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of the people of our great City, we had reaſon to expect ſome great Scourge, the ſame is now come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us. The deſtroying Angel hath drawn his Sword, hath killed thouſands already; the Plague is not onely begun, but hath waſted ſome part of that City; great Terrour is upon us; many fly thence, and perhaps die by the way, or live to infect other places; Houſes are emptied, Streets untroden, Markets without Sellers and Buiers: a heavy dolefull Diſeaſe is come upon us. Who is ſo hard-hearted, ſo Atheiſticall, as not to ſee the Hand of God in all this? The Preachers from the Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit foretold it. Any who was acquainted with the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture, with the way of God's Judgments in our own or former times, might ſee, that our exceſs of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane Swearing, Contempt of Religion and the Word of God, our unmeaſurable Pride, Vanity, Luxury, in Meat, Drink, Apparel, ſenſuall Pleaſures, our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, our Oppreſſions, our Hatred, Diviſions, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercifulneſs, and all ſorts of Vices, continually ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves openly among us, would be the Seed out of which this or the like Calamity would at length be produced. And yet where is the perſon that laies this to heart, as an effect of Divine Vengeance, and the Fruit of his Sin? Who is there that <hi>ſearcheth and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his waies,</hi> that is ſenſible of <hi>the Plague of his own Heart,</hi> that with repenting <hi>Ephraim ſmites upon his thigh,</hi> that <hi>repents him of his Wickedneſs, ſaying, What have I done?</hi> Who is there that either fears God the more, or prays the more, or amends his waies the more?
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:42122:89"/>Are not our Pride, Fulneſs of bread, Wantonneſs, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercifulneſs, yea, which is worſe, our Curſing, Swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, Lying, Rage, Blaſphemy, Lewdneſs, as much as before? Do we not (to uſe the Prophet's phraſe) <hi>every one turn</hi> yet <hi>to our courſe, as the Horſe ruſheth into the battel?</hi> Have not we yet ſuch an unſanctified, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humbled ſpirit, as to deride Preachers Monitions, to ſlight God's Judgments, to harden one another in Sin, and ſo to diſappoint God's Deſign in this Viſitation, which ſhould awaken us from our Security, humble us under his mighty Hand, bring us on our knees in ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Supplications, teach us to fear Sin, <hi>learn</hi> us <hi>to doe well, leſt a worſe thing happen to us?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If it be ſo with us, what can be expected, but that our ſeeming Humiliation, Faſting and Prayer this day ſhould become Sin to us, and be ſo far from averting the preſent Evil, as that it will provoke the Divine Vengeance to <hi>puniſh us yet ſeven times more for our Sins?</hi> For ſure, when one Judgment doth not cauſe us to return to God, he will ſend another. The more Warnings God gives us, if the fire of God's Wrath be not quenched by our Repentance and Supplications, it will burn the more fiercely. It is in vain for us to imagine, that by any other means we can prevent our Danger: this is the onely ſafe courſe for our Preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

                  <hi>provoke him to Jealouſy,</hi> unleſs we were <hi>ſtronger then he is.</hi> And therefore it is no better then Folly and Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to be ſuperficiall in this buſineſs of Searching, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing, Repenting of our Sins. We ſay, <hi>Non eſt tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum ludere cum Sacris;</hi> We muſt not trifle in things of God, we muſt not ſport with God.</p>
               <p>Neither muſt we onely be ſenſible of our own perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Sins, but of the Sins of others; our Governours, our Neighbours, our Forefathers Sins. <hi>David</hi>'s Sin may bring a Plague on the People. We are to mourn and be humbled for them eſpecially which goe unpuniſhed, which cauſe <hi>the Land to mourn.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. We muſt goe on to cry mightily to God, as the <hi>Ninevites</hi> did. The Pardoning of great Sins, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving of great Plagues, require great Mercies, and importunate Suing. Now muſt <hi>the Bridegroom goe forth of his chamber, and the Bride out of her cloſet. The Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the Lord,</hi> all ſorts of perſons, old and young, muſt cry with Tears and Supplications, <hi>Spare us, O Lord, and give not thy Heritage to reproach.</hi> We muſt <hi>lift up our hands with our hearts to God in the Heavens,</hi> as ſenſible that nothing but his Mercy can ſave us; that he is ready to hear and help, when we hope in his Mercy; that <hi>we have an Advocate with the Father, Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt the Righteous, and he is the Propitiation for our Sins.</hi> We muſt mind God of his former Mercies; truſt on him, as one that hath promiſed to <hi>deliver us</hi> when we <hi>call on him in the day of Trouble;</hi> look unto him with Patience, as being aſſured that <hi>they that wait for him ſhall not be aſhamed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. We muſt adde an unmovable Reſolution to amend our waies, to ſin no more as we have done, to <hi>abhor E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, and cleave to that which is good;</hi> in Duties of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, Prayer, Hearing God's Word, Praiſing of God, Thankſgiving, to be more frequent and ſerious; to
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:42122:90"/>
                  <hi>cleanſe our hands, and to purify our hearts from double-mindedneſs;</hi> to be upright in what we doe, <hi>walking humbly with our God,</hi> and ſeeking his Glory all our daies. And in two things eſpecially we are to deal rightly with God. 1. In doing Juſtice to others: if we be publick perſons, by puniſhing Sin, and giving juſt Sentence for all that are wronged; if private, by reſtoring that which is not our own, and righting thoſe we have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured. Remember that God abhors <hi>ex Rapina Holo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſtum,</hi> Robbery for Burnt-offerings; and that <hi>the Prayers of the unjuſt are an Abomination to the Lord.</hi> 2. In ſhewing Mercy to others. We are to be <hi>merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, as our heavenly Father is mercifull;</hi> chiefly when we beg Mercy at his hands. This is a neceſſary Duty for a Faſting-day. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58.6, 7. <hi>Is not this the Faſt,</hi> &amp;c? Now eſpecially is a time for this Duty, in which there is ſo much Want, by reaſon of the great Poverty that is come upon Families ſhut up; now that Trading is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed, and Proviſion ſo dear, and difficult to be got. As you cry to God for Help, ſo do others Neceſſities cry to you for Relief. Have you then Bowels of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy for them, as you would have Bowels of Mercy in God towards you. Let your hand be open to them, as you would have God's hand ready for you. So may you expect Preſervation in this time of Danger; at leaſt you may be aſſured, however you ſpeed now, of Life eternall hereafter. Which God grant, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Amen.</p>

                  <hi>That the Goſpel of Chriſt is the Voice of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is the expreſs Aſſertion of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> 1. Epiſt. 1.25. alluding to <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.8. <hi>But the Word of the Lord endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth for ever: and this is the Word which by the Goſpel is preached unto you.</hi> Which is demonſtratively confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,</p>
               <p n="1">1. By its own Evidence; in reſpect of which it is termed <hi>the Light of the glorious Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt, who is the Image of God,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.4. It is not denied that it is <hi>the hidden Wiſedom of God in a myſtery, which none of the Princes of the world knew;</hi> yea it is ſuch as <hi>eye hath not ſeen, ear hath not heard, nor hath it entred into the heart of man,</hi> without Revelation from him, it being not an humane Invention, but a Divine Contrivance: yet ſhining forth in the Preaching of it by <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his Miniſters, it exhibits ſuch a Light as can come from none but God. It is not like any Talmudicall Fable, or Popiſh Legend, or Poeticall Fiction, or witty Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance, the Brats of mens Fancy, or ſubtile Compoſure: But it is for the matter of it ſutable to God's Wiſedom, Goodneſs, and Holineſs; agreeable to the undoubted Oracles of God committed to the <hi>Jews;</hi> foretold and prefigured by the Prophecies of the Old Teſtament, and Shadows of the Law. Whence S. <hi>Peter</hi> tells us, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.16. <hi>We have not followed cunningly-deviſed Fables, when we made known unto you the Power and Coming of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> and verſ. 19. that Chriſtians <hi>had a more ſure word of Prophecy, to which they were to take heed, as unto a Light that ſhineth in a dark place;</hi> adding, that the Evidence of the Goſpell
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:42122:92"/>is as <hi>the Dawning of the Day, and the Ariſing of the Day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtar in the</hi> Chriſtians <hi>hearts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. And in truth, the Goſpel appears to be ſuch by its Effects. It doeth to the Heart what the Stars and the Sun do to the Eyes; it enlightens, it enlivens, it warms, it ſpirits the Heart. It doeth that which Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Reaſon could not doe, Philoſophy could not attain to, the Law could not accompliſh: It diſcovers our ſelves to our ſelves; the Being, Properties, Counſels of God to us. It turns the Heart from Sin, begets Men to God, fills the Soul with heavenly Comforts, ſtrengthens and quickens the Spirit to doe the Will of God, and to ſuffer for his Name. It makes men to be of compoſed Spirits, and celeſtiall Converſation, beyond what either Stoicall Philoſophy or Rabbinicall Dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates could raiſe men unto: to be more noble and he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roical then thoſe renowned Worthies or Patriots, which either <hi>Greeks</hi> or <hi>Romans</hi> have admired and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And (which puts it out of all doubt to be Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine) it hath ſuch Atteſtations as could be given by none but God. For beſides what <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> ſaw and heard at <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Baptiſm; beſides what S. <hi>Peter</hi> and his Collegues teſtified, who <hi>were Eye-witneſſes of his Majeſty,</hi> when <hi>he received from God the Father Honour and Glory, when there came ſuch a Voice to him from the excellent Glory, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleaſed,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.17. beſides all this, the Miracles which <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his Apoſtles did ſo convinced <hi>Nicode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> that he confeſſed, <hi>We know that thou art a Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher come from God: for no man can doe theſe Miracles which thou doeſt, except God be with him,</hi> Joh. 3.2. And that I may not be infinite in this, (though of all Points it be of moſt concernment,) the Gift of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, the fulfilling of Prophecies delivered by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:42122:93"/>wonderous Succeſs of the Goſpell in converting the World, the direfull Judgments of God on the Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers and Perſecuters of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> Chriſtians, and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell, both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> do abundantly witneſs the Divine Originall of the Goſpell of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and that it is the Voice of God; which therefore is to be heard: and that is the</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>That God's Voice is to be heard.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This not onely the Holy Scriptures tell us, but even the Light of Nature dictates. When <hi>Ehud</hi> told <hi>Eglon</hi> King of <hi>Moab,</hi> that <hi>he had a Meſſage from God to him: he aroſe out of his Seat,</hi> Judg. 3.20. All Nations re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair to the Oracles of their Gods, and take Counſel from them. When <hi>Cornelius</hi> was advertiſed that S. <hi>Peter</hi> was ſent to him from God; with all ſubmiſſion and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion he attends him, telling him, <hi>We are all here preſent before God, to hear all things that are commanded thee of God,</hi> Act. 10.33.</p>
               <p>And great Reaſon it ſhould be ſo. He is a God of Truth, that neither can be deceived, nor deceive; and therefore it is of greateſt advantage to us to hear him. Mens fooliſh Hearts hearken oftentimes to them that flatter them, that ſpeak pleaſing things; but it is to their Ruine. The Devil's Oracles are ſo ambiguous, ſo falſe, that they delude, they corrupt men to their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. But God's Voice, the Goſpell of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver miſguides, never perverts, but <hi>leads</hi> men <hi>into all Truth,</hi> for their preſent Benefit, and their everlaſting Happineſs. Beſides, God is a powerfull Lord, the <hi>one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Law-giver, who is able to ſave, and to deſtroy,</hi> Jam. 4.12. It is not ſafe to ſlight him: it is the onely way of Salvation to hearken to his Voice. We have ſo
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:42122:93"/>much wit, as, however we contemn our Inferiour's or Equall's words, yet not to neglect our Superiour's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands or Counſells. Who is there that dares deſpiſe the Sayings of a Judge on the Bench? or of the King on his Throne? How obſequious in Attention, how regardfull in Obſervance of what ſuch Potentates ſay to them, are all their Subjects? They are aware that they ſpeak with authority; that they have Puniſhments and Rewards to accompany their Commands. It is much more ſo with God: He hath power of Life and Death, Heaven and Hell are at his diſpoſall. And therefore it is neceſſary that his Voice ſhould be heard, which is a glorious Voice, a mighty Voice; heard with the Heart as well as the Ear, with Subjection of Soul as well as Reverence of Body; and that without any demurr or delay, <hi>to day,</hi> as it is in my Text. Which brings us to the next or</p>

                  <hi>That the Goſpell is to be heard to day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By ſaying <hi>to day,</hi> the Holy Ghoſt (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>limits a certain Day</hi> in which the Voice of God is to be heard: which intimates, that there is a day, and but a day, fixt for this tranſaction. <hi>To day</hi> implies ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing <hi>incluſivè,</hi> and ſomething <hi>excluſivé.</hi> That which is included is the Opportunity, and the Duration: That which is excluded is the Night ſucceeding the Day, and all Duration after, even to Eternity. The Opportunity of hearing is, while the Goſpel is prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched; while the Spirit moves upon our Hearts; while <hi>Chriſt ſtands at the door and knocks,</hi> that we may <hi>open the door,</hi> and <hi>he come in, and ſup with us, and we with him.</hi> While the <hi>Miniſters of Reconciliation, as Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadours for Chriſt,</hi> as <hi>Workers together with God, beſeech
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:42122:94"/>us that we receive not the Grace of God in vain, is the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted time,</hi> and <hi>the day of Salvation,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.1, 2.</p>
               <p>It was <hi>Jeruſalem's Day,</hi> the time of her Viſitation, while <hi>Chriſt would have gathered them</hi> to him, <hi>as a Hen gathereth her Chickens under her wings.</hi> It was the Old World's <hi>Day,</hi> while <hi>the Spirit of God</hi> did <hi>ſtrive with them,</hi> while <hi>Noah</hi> prepared the Ark, and was <hi>a Preacher of Righteouſneſs</hi> to them.</p>
               <p>The utmoſt extent is but during this preſent Life. Perhaps it may be ſhortned by our Obſtinacy, by our Grieving the Spirit of God, which moves God to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw the tender of Reconciliation, and the Influx of his Spirit, and to leave us to the <hi>Blinding of the God of this world,</hi> and the Obduration of our own Hearts. The time after this Life is quite excluded in this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. <hi>I muſt work,</hi> ſaith <hi>Chriſt,</hi> (Joh. 9.4.) <hi>the works of him that ſent me, while it is Day;</hi> (that is, <hi>while I am in this world,</hi> as he expreſſeth it verſ. 5.) <hi>the Night cometh, when no man can work.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As in Sales by the Candle, he that bids not the price before the Candle goes out, buies nothing: ſo it is in this great Merchandiſe of the <hi>rich Pearl of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Heaven;</hi> he that <hi>ſells</hi> not <hi>all</hi> before his Light is extinguiſhed, can never purchaſe the Inheritance. There is no knowledge, no wiſedome, no operation to this end, in the Grave whither we goe. Neither Prieſts Maſſes, nor Monks Prayers, nor large Alms, nor continuall Obits, can buy Remiſſion of Sins, or reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a man from the Infernal place, or ſtate of eternall Puniſhment, when once the Grave hath ſhut its mouth upon him. <hi>In the Grave there is no Remembrance of God</hi> to this effect; there is no Praiſe of him, or hearing of his Voice to Salvation: much leſs at the day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <hi>When once the Maſter of the houſe is riſen up,</hi> (ſaith our Saviour, <hi>Luk.</hi> 13.25, 27, 28.) <hi>and hath
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:42122:94"/>ſhut to the door, and ye begin to ſtand without, and to knock at the door, ſaying, Lord, Lord, open unto us; and he ſhall anſwer and ſay unto you, I know you not whence you are; depart from me, all ye workers of Iniquity:</hi> there remains nothing but <hi>weeping and gnaſhing of teeth.</hi> If men <hi>ſlumber and ſleep,</hi> and get <hi>not Oil in their Lamps</hi> and Veſſels, no admiſſion will be for them <hi>into the Wedding-chamber</hi> when <hi>the Bridegroom comes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It will not conſiſt with God's Majeſty and Honour to be always waiting upon us to doe us good. He is long patient; but <hi>(Laeſa Patientia fit Furor)</hi> his inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and abuſed Patience ends in Fury. If while God aſſigns <hi>a Day to hear his Voice,</hi> we make it <hi>a day of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation,</hi> he will <hi>ſwear in his wrath we ſhall never enter into his Reſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Beſides, the longer we defer the accepting of God's Grace, the more we make our ſelves incapable of hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kening to God's Voice. Cuſtome in Sin hardens us therein. They that are uſed to doe Evil, hardly ever learn to doe well. Often Sinning makes Sin habitual, and that begets Hardneſs of Heart: this muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, if we will hear God's Voice; which I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded for the</p>

                  <hi>That we may hear God's Voice to day, our Hearts muſt not be hardned.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Heart, in Scripture acception, comprehends all the inward Intellectuall Faculties, the Underſtanding, Memory, Conſcience, Will, and Affections, which muſt concur with the Ear in hearing God's Voice. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.17. They that had never any Preaching could never hear God's Voice. And they that have admitted it into the Ear, without opening of the inner Door of the
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:42122:95"/>Heart, want the enjoyment of it. It was <hi>Lydia</hi>'s hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, that when ſhe heard S. <hi>Paul, the Lord opened her Heart, that ſhe attended unto the things which were ſpoken,</hi> Act. 16.14. They are unhappy to whom the Lord vouchſafes not the opening of the Ear to hear his Voice: but they are moſt unhappy, and accurſed, to whoſe Ears the Voice of God comes, but their Hearts are not opened to receive it. No Curſe more direfull then that which our Saviour ſaith was fulfilled in his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditours: <hi>By hearing they heard, and did not underſtand; and ſeeing they did ſee, and not perceive. For this peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple's Heart is waxed groſs, and their Ears are dull of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and their Eyes have they cloſed; leſt at any time they ſhould ſee with their Eyes, and hear with their Ears, and ſhould underſtand with their Heart, and ſhould be converted, and I ſhould heal them,</hi> Matth. 13.14, 15.</p>
               <p>For this reaſon, as the abſenting from hearing of God's Voice is a damnable Sin; (they that come not to hear with their Ears, ſhew their Contempt of God's Grace;) ſo much more damnable is the hardening of the Heart, whereby the Voice of God is wilfully kept out of the Underſtanding, Memory, Conſcience, Will, Affections, ſo as it cannot be ſeated in them, nor they guided and ruled by it. Which thing comes to paſs by the <hi>Deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of Sin,</hi> as our Apoſtle tells us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.13. Love of any Sin, adherence to any Errour oppoſite to God's Voice, will harden the Heart, ſo as neither to admit the enlightning Brightneſs of it into the Eye of the Mind, nor the ſoftning Virtue of it into the Will, to make it pliable. Pride and Self-dependence were two of the chief Cauſes of the <hi>Jews</hi> hardening their Hearts againſt the Voice of God in the Preaching of the Goſpell by <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his Apoſtles. <hi>How can ye believe,</hi> (ſaith our Saviour, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.44.) <hi>which receive honour one of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſeek not the Honour which cometh from God
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:42122:95"/>onely?</hi> Rom. 10.3. <hi>They being ignorant of God's Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and going about to eſtabliſh their own Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, have not ſubmitted themſelves to the Righteouſneſs of God,</hi> Rom. 10.3.</p>
               <p>Thus at this day do Popiſh Juſtitiaries, who place their Righteouſneſs in their own good Merits. All ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant people, who are wedded to vain Superſtitions, harden their Hearts againſt the Voice of the Goſpell, ſo as not to be humbled for Sin, as the penitent Publican, but to boaſt themſelves, as the proud <hi>Phariſee.</hi> They receive not <hi>Chriſt</hi> joyfully, with ſinfull <hi>Zacchaeus;</hi> but reject the offers of Grace, like thoſe who <hi>judged them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves unworthy of eternall life,</hi> Act. 13.46. In like manner, <hi>the Cares of this World, the Deceitfulneſs of Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, the Pleaſures of this life,</hi> with other Luſts, <hi>choak the word of the Kingdome,</hi> ſo as that <hi>it becomes unfruitfull, Matth.</hi> 13.22. <hi>Luk.</hi> 8.14. Hence it is that worldly-minded men and voluptuous livers harden their Hearts againſt the Warnings of God's Word, ſlight the Tender of the Goſpell, imploy their wits to diſcredit it, hearken to Seducers, which foment their Luſts, and pervert their Underſtanding. As redundance of Choler in the Stomach makes it caſt up the beſt Meat as unſavoury: ſo where the Heart is filled with ſinfull Luſts, or errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Principles, they make the moſt precious Truths of the Goſpell to be loathed and refuſed. Vicious minds expell holy Doctrines: and therefore till the Heart be ſoftned, the Motions of God's Spirit will not be enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.</p>

<pb n="182" facs="tcp:42122:96"/>been ſo evidently demonſtrated to the world, that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was there any thing which was publiſhed with more manifeſt proofs, and Divine infallible aſſurance of its Truth. And to take away all doubt of Impoſture in the Publiſhers, Teſtimony hath been given to their Sincerity therein, by their relinquiſhing all outward deſirable Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, even with the ſacrificing of their own Lives.</p>
               <p>And to you of this Nation it hath been held forth with much Perſpicuity, preſſed with much Earneſtneſs. But do you hear it? do you perceive this to be the time of your Viſitation, your Day? Do you not <hi>harden your Hearts as in the Provocation?</hi> Do not your proud Spirits think it below you to ſtoop to it? May we not ſay as once the <hi>Jews</hi> did, <hi>Which of the Rulers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve on him?</hi> Do we not find <hi>the Poor receive the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell,</hi> when <hi>the Rich are ſent empty away? Surgunt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>docti, &amp; rapiunt Coelum;</hi> the Unlearned riſe up, and take Heaven by violence, when the reputed <hi>Wiſe</hi> goe on in their waies to Perdition? Do we not <hi>love the Praiſe of Men more then the Praiſe of God?</hi> Do not your love of <hi>Pleaſures</hi> and <hi>the Cares of this world choak the Word,</hi> and <hi>make it unfruitfull?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I come not to accuſe you, but would have you <hi>judge your ſelves,</hi> as knowing that you <hi>ſhall be judged</hi> by the Lord, and, if you prevent it not by <hi>ſelf-judging, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned with the World.</hi> Take it as a warning, out of a moſt ardent deſire I have to ſave your Souls, that I tell you, that there are ſhrewd Symptoms of the Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of your Heart, and Averſeneſs from hearing God's Voice; in that places of Paſtime and Pleaſure, houſes of Good-fellowſhip, are ſo much frequented as they are, and the Church of God neglected; in that Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances, profane Hiſtories, yea Diſcourſes ſavouring of Atheiſm, are bought up, and read with more delight then the Bible, or any other Holy Writings; we take
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:42122:96"/>more pleaſure to furniſh our Fancy, then to rectify our Conſcience.</p>
               <p>Are you not ſenſible that God hath <hi>limited</hi> you <hi>a certain time to hear his Voice?</hi> that your <hi>daies are num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred,</hi> and your <hi>months, that you cannot paſs?</hi> that while the Goſpell is preached, is your <hi>Day of Salvation?</hi> that if the Sun of your Life be ſet, the Day of the Goſpell darkned over you, there will be no time left to make your Peace, to ſave your immortall Spirits? that if you harden your Hearts, there remains nothing after this Day but Hell and eternall Judgment? Think ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly then upon your Condition, and <hi>while it is called to day,</hi> provide for Eternity. Hear God's Voice rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily and conſtantly. Harden not your Hearts by Pride, Luxury, Covetouſneſs, Superſtition, or any other evil Luſts. Submit your Underſtandings to God's Wiſedom. Retain his Word in your Memory and Conſcience. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve him againſt your own Fancies. Conform your Wills to his. Receive his Truth in the love of it, and you ſhall be ſaved by it. Which he grant, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Amen.</p>

            <p>TO acquit the Goſpel (which he preached) from the Exceptions and Obloquies which it, and the Preachers of it, were obnoxious to, and to demonſtrate the Wiſedom and Power of God in his proceedings concerning it, S. <hi>Paul</hi> (in this Epiſtle, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to the greateſt and moſt intelligent People of the Gentiles,) declares both the extreme Corruptions of the whole World, and the Wrath of God impendent on them for that reaſon; as alſo the unparallel'd Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganimity of God, in bearing with ſuch a provoking Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, whom Hell had long waited for; and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, the incomprehenſible Philanthropy or Loving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindneſs
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:42122:98"/>of God towards men, whom, though Enemies, though weak to reſiſt him, he not onely ſpareth, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo reconcileth to himſelf by the Bloud of his own Son, and proclaimeth his free Pardon to all that receive him, by his Apoſtles.</p>
            <p>But leſt Mercy abuſed ſhould inflame the Wrath of God ſo much the more; leſt the ſweeteſt Meat, undi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted through a Surfeit, ſhould be putrefied in the Stomach, and turn to the moſt deadly Poiſon; he in this and the following Chapters warns us of the ill In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference which men may make from ſo great Goodneſs: and he begins at the words now read unto you, <hi>What ſhall we ſay then? ſhall we continue in Sin, that Grace may abound? God forbid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In which words are two Queſtions: the former where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is onely a form of Tranſition, propounding it to the conſideration of thoſe to whom he writes, that they with him ſhould bethink themſelves what Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination to make upon his former Declaration, <hi>What ſhall we ſay then?</hi> If this be the ſtate of affairs between God and us, it concerns us to heed what thereupon we reſolve to doe.</p>
            <p>The other Queſtion is more particular; <hi>Shall we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in Sin, that Grace may abound?</hi> Shall this be the Inference we make from it? The Anſwer is negative; <hi>Abſit, God forbid.</hi> Let no ſo abſurd, ſo unworthy an Abuſe of ſo rich Mercy be yielded to; though it be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo plauſibly urged by our carnal Reaſon, and our corrupt Affections would incline us to embrace the Motion.</p>
            <p>In this paſſage of Scripture theſe following Concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are couched.</p>

               </p>
               <p>That <hi>abundant Grace</hi> which is here ſuppoſed is the ſame with that which he ſpeaks of <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.20, 21. <hi>Moreover, the Law entred, that the Offence might abound: but where Sin abounded, Grace did much more abound: That as Sin hath reigned unto Death; even ſo might Grace reign through Righteouſneſs unto eternal Life, by Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</hi> Which elſewhere, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.7. he terms <hi>the Riches of his Grace; In whom we have Redemption through his bloud, the forgiveneſs of Sins, according to the Riches of his Grace.</hi> And <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.4, 5, 7. <hi>God who is rich in Mercy, for his great Love wherewith he loved us, even when we were dead in Sins, hath quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened us together with Chriſt: That in the Ages to come he might ſhew the exceeding Riches of his Grace, in his Kindneſs towards us, through Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> And <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.8. it is termed <hi>the unſearchable Riches of Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All which Expreſſions are true, without an Exceſs of ſpeech, if we conſider either the State of mankind an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent to the exhibition of this Grace; or the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects thereof, or the Means of exhibiting it.</p>
               <p>For what more deplorable Condition (except that of Devils) could the World be in, then it was in before the exhibiting of the Divine Evangelical Grace of <hi>Chriſt</hi> to the ſons of men? They had <hi>all ſinned, and came ſhort of the Glory of God:</hi> they were <hi>concluded,</hi> as Malefactours condemned, <hi>under Sin, under the Curſe</hi> of
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:42122:99"/>the Law; <hi>dead in Treſpaſſes and Sins:</hi> they were <hi>alienated from the Life that is in God; Enemies in their minds by wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked works; fooliſh, diſobedient, ſerving divers Luſts, hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and hating one another; children of Diſobedience, of Darkneſs,</hi> who <hi>walked after the courſe of the Prince of the power of the Air:</hi> they were <hi>carried away after dumb I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols;</hi> were Vaſſals of Satan, and <hi>children of Wrath by nature.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And yet even to ſuch did <hi>the Loving-kindneſs of God towards Man appear,</hi> ſo as to <hi>reconcile the world unto himſelf, not imputing their Treſpaſſes to them.</hi> He <hi>made him to be Sin for us, who knew no Sin; that we might be made his Righteouſneſs in him:</hi> and <hi>committed the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry of Reconciliation to choſen Veſſels,</hi> which might <hi>bear his Name to the Gentiles,</hi> and bring Light and Salvation to ſuch perſons.</p>
               <p>It was no ſmall Teſtimony of his Goodneſs, that (e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven then when they were ſuch, when they walked in their own ways) he <hi>gave them Rain from Heaven, and fruitfull ſeaſons, filling their hearts with food and glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;</hi> that he <hi>cauſed his Sun to ſhine upon</hi> ſuch <hi>unjuſt</hi> people, as were both <hi>Jews</hi> and Gentiles.

Yet even ſuch as theſe he <hi>waſhed,</hi> he <hi>ſanctified,</hi> he <hi>juſtified in the Name of the Lord Jeſus, and by his Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It might rather have been expected, that he ſhould have <hi>repented that he had made them,</hi> and have executed his Wrath on them, as he did on <hi>the world of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly</hi> in <hi>Noah</hi>'s time, by a Deluge of water, to waſh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from the Earth that Dunghill and filth of evil I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginations and wicked Works that had polluted the whole Earth; or ſhould have rained Fire and brimſtone from Heaven, to burn up, and ſo to take away, thoſe unclean <hi>Sodomites,</hi> thoſe brutiſh Dogs and Swine which filled the World. He might juſtly have cauſed the Earth to open its mouth, and ſwallow up the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of the world, ſo as that they ſhould go down quick into Hell, as it did the Families of <hi>Korah, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than,</hi> and <hi>Abiram.</hi> He might have <hi>ſworn in his Wrath,</hi> (as he did concerning the Rebellious <hi>Iſraelites,</hi>) <hi>that they ſhould never enter into his Reſt.</hi> They and we in all Generations ſucceeding might have expected to <hi>ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the Vengeance of eternal fire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But <hi>O Altitudo, O the depth of the riches both of the Wiſedom and Knowledge</hi> and Love <hi>of God! how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearchable are his Judgments, and his ways paſt finding out?</hi> Even in this deſperate State, when Iniquity was at the height, when the Sins of men were ripe, the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt come to its full growth, when they lay <hi>weltring in their own bloud, he ſaid unto</hi> ſuch out-caſt, helpleſs ſons of <hi>Adam, Live:</hi> he hath ſwaddled, waſhed, nouriſhed, decked, married to his Son ſuch forlorn Creatures, done the greateſt Good to the worſt of men: he <hi>ſo lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the World, that he gave his onely-begotten Son, that

               </p>
               <p>The Apoſtle <hi>Jude</hi> in his Epiſtle, verſ. 4. tells us of ſome <hi>ungodly men</hi> in his time, who <hi>turned the Grace of God into Laſciviouſneſs.</hi> But it is an Abuſe not peculiar to thoſe onely; it is a Diſeaſe which is hereditary. How many are there who preſume on God's Mercy, though they perſiſt in their Impenitency? Is it not a fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent thing with many, that profane the Name of God by an hourly Abuſe of it in vain Swearing, that ſpend a great part of their lives in Debauchery, ſo as to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come more like Beaſts then Men, to live <hi>more Pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum,</hi> or <hi>more Ferarum,</hi> as Senſualiſts, rather then Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious perſons, as Devils, rather then Saints; yet to feed themſelves with imaginations of God's Grace, as if God would be mercifull to ſuch, <hi>Chriſt</hi> died for All, God would damn None? to bolſter up themſelves in Sin, deluding themſelves with Conceits of Pardon, if at laſt Gaſp they can but cry <hi>Peccavi,</hi> when they love their Sin as much as they did, and grieve onely that they cannot ſtill commit it, or that God awards Hell to the Actours of it; and cry God mercy in a faint <hi>Miſerere mei,</hi> God be mercifull to me, when they have neither acquaintance with his Promiſe, nor any lively ſenſe of his Love in <hi>Chriſt?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How great a part of the ſons of men expoſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to Temptations, and give way to ſinfull Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in Errour or unrighteous Practices, out of a fond

                  <hi>That it is a fooliſh Conceit, that we may ſecurely conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in Sin, and expect Favour from God, becauſe of his ſuperabundant Grace in Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is manifeſt, becauſe it is a groundleſs and vain Preſumption; there being no Promiſe or other Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of God which aſſures his Grace to ſuch perſons.</p>
               <p>Promiſe of Pardon of Sin is made onely to the Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent: <hi>Mercy</hi> to him that <hi>confeſſeth and forſaketh his Sin.</hi> Onely a <hi>working Faith,</hi> that is in <hi>Chriſt</hi> operative <hi>by Love, avails</hi> with God to the Juſtification of a Sinner. New Obedience is requiſite to the Continuance of our Peace with God; a holy Life, to eternal Life.</p>
               <p>We reade of <hi>David</hi>'s Forgiveneſs, and we reade al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of <hi>David</hi>'s Confeſſion: he acknowledgeth his Sin, before <hi>Nathan</hi> tells him, <hi>The Lord hath put away thy Sin.</hi> We reade of God's Mercy to <hi>Manaſſeh:</hi> but the ſame Story tells us of his humbling himſelf firſt. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was ſaved, though the <hi>chief of Sinners;</hi> but not
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:42122:101"/>till he was converted, and thereby made a real Saint.</p>
               <p>Were it ſo that Grace were beſtowed on hardned Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, it would be in effect a cheriſhing of Rebellion. When a Prince pardons a Traitour, he will firſt have him an humble Supplicant, lay down his Weapons, and fall proſtrate at his feet. Elſe he ſhould maintain Enemies, not ſecure his Dominion: he ſhould, in the event, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy himſelf, by ſaving his Foe: ſuch Pity to them would prove Cruelty to himſelf.</p>
               <p>It is ſo in God's Royall Government. Should he ſhew himſelf facil and forward in beſtowing his moſt bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial Grace on open Sinners, that perſiſt in their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations, or on ſecret Hypocrites, that are falſe-hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, he ſhould, in ſtead of upholding his Kingdom, ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine it; in ſtead of gaining good Subjects, nouriſh Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers in his boſome.</p>
               <p>It is a Maxim with him in his Holy Polity, That <hi>when the Righteous turneth away from his Righteouſneſs, and committeth Iniquity, his Righteouſneſs that he hath done ſhall not be mentioned: in his Treſpaſs that he hath treſpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and in his Sin that he hath ſinned, in them ſhall he die, Ezek.</hi> 18.24. This is <hi>the way of God,</hi> which he counts, as it is indeed, moſt <hi>equall:</hi> it being altogether incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruous to God's Holineſs to abett Evil. For that would foſter ſuch Conceits in men, as thoſe were in him of whom God ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.21. <hi>Theſe things haſt thou done, and I kept ſilence: thou thoughteſt that I was alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether ſuch an one as thy ſelf.</hi> Then which there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more oppoſite to his pure Nature, nothing being more repugnant to him then Sin. Such Imputations therefore are the greateſt Diſparagements of God; the fouleſt Reproaches, the moſt hainous Injuries, the moſt monſtrous Indignities that can be caſt on the Divine Majeſty: it being all one as to metamorphoſe him into a Devil.</p>
               <pb n="193" facs="tcp:42122:101"/>
               <p>All Sin is from the Devil; and therefore for God to beſtow his Grace on him that continues in Sin, were to countenance the Devil's Actings, to breed up his Brats: in ſtead of <hi>deſtroying the works of the Devil,</hi> ſuch In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence would promote them. God ſhould be an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregious Diſſembler: he ſhould in word forbid Sin, in deed command it: he ſhould take to himſelf the name of a Righteous God, and act as the Authour of Sin: he ſhould threaten Sinners as if he were in jeſt, not in earneſt; give liberty and allowance to a diſſembling Hypocrite to mock him to his face, while he makes a ſhew of honouring God, when he ſues for his Grace, and yet in Heart derides the Word of the living God.</p>
               <p>The Intention of God in exhibiting his ſurpaſſing Grace, is, to <hi>draw</hi> the Hearts of men by <hi>the Chords of love</hi> to him the more abundantly; that (as it is ſaid of that woman, <hi>Luk.</hi> 7.47. that <hi>her Sins, which were many, were forgiven, for ſhe loved much,</hi>) much Love might be the fruit of much Grace. Whereas the Continuance in Sin out of the fancy of ſuperabundant Grace, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to abuſe the Love of God to the increaſe of Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred againſt him; Spider-like, to ſuck Poiſon out of that Flower which a Bee would convert to the ſwee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Hony. In the end, this courſe is moſt pernicious to him that follows it; there being nothing that more alienates Affection from a perſon, then his abuſe of Kindneſs. God's Love abuſed, turns to Rage: and none have God more incenſed againſt them, then thoſe that, <hi>having taſted of the good Gift of God, fall away</hi> into ſinfull Courſes; that are ſo unthankfull for ſo great a Favour as the offer of Reconciliation, the Sacrifice of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the Invitation to his Supper, to the Marriage of the Son of God, as that they chuſe rather to be at home with their Oxen and Wives and Farms, or to come without a Wedding-garment, then to accept of his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:42122:102"/>and accommodate themſelves to his Kindneſs; that having had ten thouſand Talents forgiven them, take their Brother by the throat for an hundred pence.</p>
               <p>When men <hi>deſpiſe the Riches of God's Goodneſs, and Forbearance, and Long-ſuffering, not knowing that the Goodneſs of God leadeth them to Repentance; after their hardneſs and impenitent Hearts, they treaſure up to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Wrath againſt the day of Wrath, and revelation of the righteous Judgment of God,</hi> Rom. 2.4, 5.</p>

               </p>
               <p>It is moſt meet, yea natural, that Love ſhould beget Love, Grace ſhould beget Obſervance. Is not he a moſt egregious Villain, that hates his own Father that begat him, that kills him that gave him Life? Is not the Lord <hi>the Rock who begat thee, the God that formed thee?</hi> And wilt thou then be ſo unnatural as to hate God, as thou doſt, if this be thy Requital for his Grace, to perſevere in Wickedneſs?</p>
               <p>He tells thee, that he is hated, when thou <hi>loveſt any thing more then him, giveſt his Glory to another,</hi> makeſt <hi>thy Belly thy God, glorieſt in thy Shame, mindeſt earthly things:</hi> And wilt thou thus recompenſe ſo great Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with ſuch extreme Badneſs? He ſaith, he <hi>will not hold him guiltleſs that taketh his Name in vain:</hi> And wilt thou pollute the Holy Name of thy Holy Father
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:42122:102"/>with thy impure Swearing? <hi>The earnal mind is Enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty againſt God,</hi> as being <hi>not ſubject to his Law,</hi> but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with it: And wilt thou ſuffer vain Thoughts to lodge in thee, fleſhly Reaſon to ſway with thee, carnal Luſts to rule over thee?</p>
               <p>All Benefits received engage to anſwerable Duty. What art thou then but a very Miſcreant, that (having ſo much <hi>taſte how gracious God is,</hi> how amply he hath vouchſafed to be bountifull to thee in giving <hi>Chriſt</hi> for thee, how profuſely he hath beſtowed on thee the Riches of Heaven in the largeſs of <hi>Spiritual Bleſſings in heavenly things</hi> in <hi>Chriſt,</hi>) doſt yet ſide with Sin and Satan, his profeſt irreconcilable Enemies; that canſt harbour that Enemy, which thy Allegeance to God binds thee to purſue zealouſly unto death?</p>
               <p>Oh that rather the Senſe of God's Goodneſs might make us good, the Taſte of his Grace might make us gracious. Surely none are worſe Enemies to God, then ſuch as have been acquainted with the exceſs of God's Grace in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> yet exceed in their obſtinate perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in Evil: ſuch as, when God's Grace ſhould draw Tears from their Eyes, Sighs from their Breaſts, cauſe Dejectedneſs in their Spirits by reaſon of their Sinning againſt ſo incomprehenſible a Love, as that which he vouchſafes to the Sons of <hi>Adam</hi> in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> have yet a Forehead of braſs, that cannot bluſh; glory in their Wickedneſs, boaſt of their Lewdneſs, and are ſecure in their Impenitency.</p>
               <p>Greater <hi>Woe</hi> was to <hi>Chorazin</hi> and <hi>Bethſaida</hi> then to <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sidon,</hi> becauſe they repented not upon ſuch Proofs of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Excellency, as would have wrought on the other. As they had been <hi>lifted up to Heaven;</hi> ſo <hi>Chriſt</hi> foretells their <hi>caſting down to Hell.</hi> No peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the world are likely to have a greater degree of Torment in Hell, then profane and unrighteous men
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:42122:103"/>among us, who have the greateſt Proof of God's Grace of any people on the Earth.</p>
               <p>As then you either ſtand in fear of ſo great Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or are deſirous of that abundant Grace which the Goſpel of <hi>Chriſt</hi> exhibits, abhorr the thought of <hi>Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing in Sin, that Grace may abound.</hi> Let the Mercies of God lead you to <hi>preſent your Bodies a living Sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reaſonable Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice:</hi> for that will procure his Favour here, and your Bleſſedneſs hereafter. Which he grant, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Amen.</p>

            <p>I Have read to you a paſſage out of a moſt dolefull Poem, compoſed by that Holy Prophet <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> with much Art in the four firſt Chapters, the order of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Alphabet being obſerved in the initiall Letters of the Verſes; yet with a very deep ſenſe of God's Judgments on <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Jernſalem,</hi> and a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Sympathy with them in their Affliction. He had long and often foretold thoſe Evils would befall them, which he now ſaw come upon them, <hi>&amp; quorum pars magna fuit,</hi> and in which he had a great Share: and he might well ſay, <hi>(Quis talia fando, temperet à lacry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis?)</hi> Who could think or ſpeak of ſuch things with dry Eyes, or an inſenſible Spirit?</p>
            <p>This ſet (may I ſay his Muſe? I ſhould ſay rather) his Prophetick ſpirit on work, to endite and leave to the Church this Poem. In which, with much Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion towards his Country, he bewails their Deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: yet, with much Piety towards God, juſtifies him, as puniſhing them according to the Demerit of
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:42122:104"/>their Sins; and magnifies his Goodneſs, as puniſhing them leſs then they deſerved. Both which are expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the words of my Text, <hi>It is of the Lord's Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies that we are not conſumed, becauſe his Compaſſions fail not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſure we may ſay the like, <hi>It is of the Lord's Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies that London</hi> and all <hi>England are not conſumed</hi> by the Peſtilence, <hi>becauſe his Compaſſions fail not.</hi> And therefore the handling of this Paſſage will be appoſite to the preſent Face of things with us, and the Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this Day? In it,
<list>
                  <item>1. The Prophet takes notice of the Mitigation of God's Wrath, in that they were <hi>not conſumed.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. He aſſigns the genuine Cauſe of it, <hi>the Lord's Mercies</hi> or Benignities, great Mercies: which is exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive of any other procuring Cauſe that might deſerve it; and intimates, that there was ſufficient reaſon (did not his Mercies interpoſe) why he ſhould have conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med them.</item>
                  <item>3. Theſe Mercies are deſcribed, 1. By the kind of them; they were <hi>Compaſſions,</hi> in the Original, <hi>Bowel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercies,</hi> ſuch as a tender Mother hath to the Child of her womb; in God, Pardoning Mercies, Relieving Mercies. 2. By the Indeſiciency of them: Though men fail in their Duty, though they fail in their Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, though they be wanting in Returning to God, though their Prayers be conſumed; yet his <hi>Compaſſions</hi> are not conſumed, and therefore <hi>they are not conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>And this is here alleged as <hi>a Door of Hope,</hi> (to the prophet) that God would reſtore that People: for to that end are theſe words brought in this place, as that which follows in four Verſes of this Chapter plainly ſhews.

                  <hi>That the Lord doth not, in Puniſhing of his People, conſume them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is equivalent to what God ſpeaks in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> (57.16.) <hi>I will not contend for ever, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will I be always wroth.</hi> And he gives this Reaſon, <hi>For the Spirit ſhould fail before me, and the Soul which I have made.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is true, <hi>the Devil</hi> is <hi>a roaring Lion,</hi> that <hi>goes about, ſeeking whom he may devour,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.8. He is the <hi>Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyon,</hi> the <hi>Abaddon, the Thief that comes</hi> not to ſave, but <hi>to ſteal and to kill and to deſtroy,</hi> Joh. 10.10. becauſe <hi>the Sheep are not his own.</hi> He made nothing, nor hath any Love to any thing; and therefore ſeeks not to help any, but to marre and doe miſchief to all that God hath made. But the People of God are <hi>the work
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:42122:105"/>of his hands,</hi> and <hi>the Sheep of his Paſture,</hi> Pſal. 100.3. and therefore he <hi>will have a deſire to the work of his hands,</hi> Job 14.15. What is our work, we are loth to pull down. So God, doubtleſs, doth not delight, as Children, to make a houſe of Sticks, and then kick it down again. As he <hi>made Man after his own Image;</hi> ſo he is not eaſily induced to break him. He that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts it an hainous Injury to himſelf, to <hi>curſe Man with the Tongue,</hi> who is <hi>made after his Image,</hi> Jam. 3.9. and is ſo ſevere againſt what-ever ſhall deſtroy him, that it is his ſtrict Determination, for Preſervation of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind after the Floud, that he will not let the killing of Man go unrevenged; but enacteth this Law among his Precepts to <hi>Noah,</hi> Gen. 9.5, 6. <hi>And ſurely your bloud of your Lives will I require: at the hand of every Beaſt will I require it, and at the hand of Man; at the hands of every man's Brother will I require the Life of man. Whoſo ſheddeth man's bloud, by man ſhall his bloud be ſhed: for in the Image of God made he man;</hi> He doubtleſs is ſo chary of Men, as not to conſume them himſelf utterly, till Iniquity is grown ſo daring, as that there is no Remedy.</p>
               <p>His own People, it is true, do ſin and provoke God, and he often brings them low; yet he doth not <hi>make an utter end</hi> of them, becauſe they are not onely his Creatures, as others, but alſo his <hi>Redeemed</hi> and <hi>Choſen people.</hi> Thus the Prophet <hi>Samuel</hi> told the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.20, 22. <hi>Fear not, (ye have done all this Wickedneſs: yet turn not aſide from following the Lord, but ſerve the Lord with all your heart:) For the Lord will not forſake his people for his great Name's ſake, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it hath pleaſed the Lord to make you his People.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That which a man hath purchaſed for himſelf, he will hardly let it be taken from him: with much more reluctancy will he caſt it away. Though <hi>Michal</hi> had
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:42122:105"/>been given to another, and was defiled, yet <hi>David</hi> would have her again, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3.13. becauſe he had eſpouſed her to him for <hi>an hundred Foreskins of the Philiſtines.</hi> How much leſs will God let go thoſe whom he hath purchaſed by his Son's Bloud? He will not have <hi>him deſtroyed by our Meat, for whom Chriſt died,</hi> Rom. 14.15. If any, through the <hi>Watchman</hi>'s failing to <hi>warn them,</hi> periſh, <hi>their bloud will he require at the Watchman's hands,</hi> Ezek. 3.18. Which ſhews, that he hath a Fatherly Care of his own People, that they be not conſumed. And though they provoke him, ſo as to cauſe his <hi>Anger to wax hot againſt them;</hi> yet in the midſt of Judgment, he remembers Mercy. He chaſtiſeth as a Father; doth not exterminate or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpate as an Enemy. <hi>If they break his Statutes, and keep not his Commandments; Then he will viſit their Tranſgreſſion with a Rod, and their Iniquity with Stripes. Nevertheleſs his Loving-kindneſs he will not utterly take from them, nor ſuffer his Faithfulneſs to fail,</hi> Pſal. 89.31, 32, 33. Though <hi>he make a full end of all the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, yet he will not make a full end of them, but correct them in meaſure; yet will he not leave them wholly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puniſhed,</hi> Jer. 46.28. Wherein he manifeſts a mixture of Mercy and Juſtice. And therefore, in the next place,</p>

                  <hi>Holy perſons aſcribe not the Mitigation of God's ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme Severity in his Puniſhments to any promeriting Cauſe in themſelves, but confeſs their own Sins deſerve utter Conſumption.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This was the acknowledgment of <hi>Ezra; Thou our God haſt puniſhed us leſs then our Iniquities deſerve, Ezra</hi> 9.13. Though the Puniſhment of the <hi>Jews</hi> were
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:42122:106"/>exceeding great, inſomuch that our Prophet, <hi>Lament.</hi> 4.6. compares it to <hi>the Puniſhment of the Sin of Sodom,</hi> and aggravates it, as <hi>ſecundùm quid,</hi> in ſome reſpect, <hi>greater then</hi> it: yet, to ſpeak ſimply and abſolutely, there was an ingredient of Mercy that did allay it, and therefore they acknowledge their Sins to have deſerved greater Evils then they felt. Whence in all their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes to God, they aſcribe <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> to their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, and take all the Blame of their Sufferings on them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. In the ſame Chapter, verſ. 15. <hi>O Lord God of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Ezra,</hi>) <hi>thou art Righteous, for we remain yet eſcaped, as at this day.</hi> But moſt fully the Prophet <hi>Daniel,</hi> Chapter 9.11, 12, 13, 14. <hi>We have ſinned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Lord our God: And he hath confirmed the words which he ſpake againſt us, by bringing upon us a great Evil: for under the whole Heaven hath not been done as hath been done upon Jeruſalem. Yet made we not our Prayer before the Lord our God, that we might turn from our Iniquities, and underſtand thy Truth. Therefore hath the Lord watched upon the Evil, and brought it upon us: for the Lord our God is Righteous in all his works which he doeth; for we obeyed not his voice.</hi> See alſo verſ. 5, 6, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of the ſame Chapter.</p>
               <p>And indeed ſuch Acknowledgments are neceſſary, and are always made by thoſe who are wiſe-hearted in all Generations: for the very beſt of Men or People can never acquit themſelves from being guilty of ſuch Iniquities as might juſtly expoſe them to greater Wrath then they feel. <hi>There is not a Juſt man upon earth that doeth good, and ſinneth not,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon,</hi> Eccles. 7.20. <hi>Who can ſay, I have made my Heart clean, I am pure from my Sin?</hi> Prov. 20.9. Holy <hi>Job,</hi> of whom God teſtifieth, that he was <hi>his Servant, none like him in the Earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feared God, and eſchewed Evil,</hi> Job 1.8. though he ſtill avouched
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:42122:106"/>his Integrity; yet when he is to ſpeak of his Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as they come from God, he is creſt-fallen, lets down his Plumes, ſpeaks in ſuch forms as theſe: <hi>How ſhould a man be juſt with God? If he will contend with him, he cannot anſwer him one of a thouſand. If I juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie my ſelf, mine own mouth ſhall condemn me: if I ſay, I am perfect, it ſhall alſo prove me perverſe. If I waſh my ſelf with Snow-water, and make my hands never ſo clean: Yet ſhalt thou plunge me in the ditch, and mine own cloaths ſhall abhor me,</hi> Job 9.2, 3, 20, 30, 31. He makes no ſuch plea for himſelf as the proud <hi>Phariſee,</hi> that truſted in himſelf that he was Righteous, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed others: nor doth he out of meer Modeſty ſpeak thus of himſelf, but out of the ſenſe of the verity thereof, he confeſſeth concerning all the Sons of <hi>Adam, Job</hi> 14.4. <hi>Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? not one.</hi> The Septuagint reads, verſ. 5. <hi>No, though his life be but one day upon earth;</hi> and after them the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, <hi>Though he be but Infans unius diei, an Infant of one day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We reade of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> Iſa. 38.3. that he deprecated the Sentence of his Death in theſe words; <hi>Remember now, O Lord, I beſeech thee, how I have walked before thee in truth, and with a perfect Heart, and have done that which is good in thy ſight:</hi> Yet when the Sentence was reverſed, he doth not aſcribe it to his own deſert, but, verſ. 17. he thus ſpeaks to God; <hi>Thou haſt in love to my Soul delivered it from the Pit of corruption: for thou haſt caſt all my Sins behind thy back.</hi> He doth not, like a proud <hi>Phariſee,</hi> impute his Recovery to his own Righteouſneſs; nor, like ſome boaſting Frier, brag of his own Merits or Works of Supererogation: Such language of Self-juſtitiaries, ſuch Conceits of men puf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed up with arrogant Self-eſteem, were far from him. He ſpeaks like an humble Penitent, not like a vain
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:42122:107"/>
                  <hi>Glorioſo.</hi> He aſſigns as the cauſe of his Recovery, not his own Merit, but God's pardoning Mercy.</p>
               <p>Nor can any People juſtly reckon their own Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency as the cauſe of God's ſparing them; but muſt (if they will ſpeak truth) acknowledge they have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to be conſumed. Though <hi>David,</hi> when the Peſtilence was upon <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſaid, <hi>Lo, I have ſinned, and I have done wickedly; but theſe Sheep what have they done?</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.17. yet that there were Iniquities in the People which occaſioned <hi>David</hi>'s Sin, is plain from verſ. 1. where it is ſaid, that <hi>the Anger of the Lord was kindled againſt Iſrael.</hi>

               <p>The Churches of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the Primitive times were the pureſt; yet S. <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.20, 21. ſaith, he <hi>feared, leſt when he came to Corinth he ſhould not find them ſuch as he would, and that he ſhould be found unto them ſuch as they would not: leſt there be Debates, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vyings, Wraths, Strifes, Backbitings, Whiſperings, Swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, Tumults: leſt when he came again his God would humble him among them, and that he ſhould bewail many which had ſinned already, and had not repented of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncleanneſs which they had committed.</hi>

               <p>In <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Survey of the Seven Golden Candleſticks, the Seven Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> though golden or pure by his Acceptance, yet he finds much droſſy ſtuff, their Light but dim, and almoſt waſted, and ready to go out; ſuch Imperfections, ſuch Errours, ſuch Decays, ſuch Practices of evil ſavour, as were enough to move him to extinguiſh their Light quite, and to remove the Candleſticks, except they repented.</p>
               <p>It is by reaſon of man's deceitfull Heart, that God finds, even in the beſt Men and Churches, ſufficient matter againſt them to conſume them: which yet he permits by his own juſt Decree and wiſe Counſel, that he may <hi>hide Pride from man,</hi> and <hi>none might glory in

               </p>
               <p>It is true, Mercy and Compaſſion, as they are in Man, are Perturbations, which do diſquiet them: Compaſſion in them is a dolorous Paſſion, ariſing from ſome appearing Evil, that is deſtructive, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe grievous, which happens to a man undeſervedly. And it is occaſioned by a ſenſe of the common Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of men, and a poſſibility of the like Accident be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falling themſelves; as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> deſcribes it in the Second Book of his Rhetorick.</p>
               <p>But in God, who is without Body, Parts, or Paſſions, (as the Firſt Article of the Church of <hi>England</hi> ſpeaks,) there is no ſuch Perturbation, no afflicting Affection: But Compaſſion in him is a ſweet, calm, and gracious Inclination of his Will, whereby he hath regard to the Defects and Miſeries of his Creature.</p>
               <p>This Attribute is aſſerted by himſelf, in that moſt majeſtick Proclamation of his, when he <hi>ſhewed his Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> and <hi>made all his Goodneſs to paſs before Moſes,</hi> Exod. 33.18, 19. <hi>deſcended in a Cloud, paſſed by him, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed the Name of the Lord, The Lord, the Lord God, Mereifull and Gracious, Long-ſuffering, and abundant in Goodneſs and Truth,</hi> Exod. 34.5, 6. The ſame hath been by many of the Holy Writers atteſted: it being the great engaging Property of God, whereby all his Creatures, chiefly his Elect, are eternally obliged to be his. Thus he is ſtyled by the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 116.5. <hi>Gracious is the Lord and Righteous, yea our God is Mercifull:</hi> by S. <hi>James,</hi> (5.11.) a God <hi>very pitifull,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:42122:108"/>and of tender Mercies,</hi> or of much <hi>Bowels of Compaſſion:</hi> by S. <hi>Paul, the Father of mercies, and the God of all Conſolation,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.3. <hi>rich in Mercy,</hi> Eph. 2.4. And therefore Mercy is moſt truly aſcribed to him: ſo that as <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaid, <hi>There is none Good but one, that is, God, Mark</hi> 10.18. ſo we may ſay, There is none Mercifull or compaſſionate but one, that is, God; underſtanding it of the moſt intenſive Degree, <hi>(quoad Affectum,)</hi> in reſpect of the diſpoſition of his Will to help; and of the moſt extenſive Latitude, <hi>(quoad Effectum,)</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the Effect and working of it; for ſo it is uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 145.9. <hi>The Lord is good to All, and his tender Mercies</hi> (in ſome kind) <hi>are over all his works. Thy Mercy, (O Lord) is in the Heavens, and thy Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs reacheth to the Clouds. Thy Righteouſneſs is like the great Mountains; thy Judgments are a great Deep: O Lord, thou preſerveſt Man and Beaſt,</hi> Pſal. 36.5, 6. And <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſets out the Mercifulneſs of God, in that he <hi>maketh his Sun to riſe on the Evil and the Good, and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth Rain on the Juſt and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>njuſt,</hi> Matth. 5.45.</p>
               <p>But his Mercies are moſt abundant to his own Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, chiefly to his Elect; who are therefore termed <hi>Veſſells of Mercy,</hi> Rom. 9.23. on whom he beſtows Mercies moſt freely. <hi>He ſaith to Moſes, I will have Mercy on whom I will have Mercy; and I will have Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion on whom I will have Compaſſion,</hi> verſ. 15. On them he beſtows <hi>the ſure Mercies of David,</hi> Iſa. 55.3. <hi>Not by works of Righteouſneſs which they have done, but according to his Mercy he ſaves them, by the waſhing of Regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> Tit. 3.5. He <hi>keeps Mercy for thouſands of them that love him, and keep his Commandments,</hi> Exod. 20.6. Yea, for their ſakes he doth often ſhew Mercy to and ſpare thoſe that are diſobedient, in reſpect of outward Judgments. Thus <hi>Moſes ſtood in the Gap,</hi> and <hi>turned away his Wrath</hi> from
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:42122:108" rendition="simple:additions"/>the Children of <hi>Iſrael. Phineas ſtood up, and executed Judgment,</hi> or prayed, <hi>and the Plague was ſtayed. Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> ſupplicated for <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and the Angel of the Lord put up his Sword, and the Peſtilence was ſtayed. <hi>Daniel</hi> prayed, and obtained the Return of the <hi>Jews</hi> from Captivity. And thus ſtill God does to his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, in the midſt of Judgment he remembers Mercy. <hi>He doth not always chide, nor keep his Anger for ever, Pſal.</hi> 103.9. <hi>He retaineth not his Anger for ever, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he delighteth in Mercy,</hi> Mic. 7.18. And this brings us to the</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>That God's Mercies and Compaſſions fail not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this purpoſe is that the Lord ſaith <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54.7, 8. <hi>For a ſmall moment have I forſaken thee, but with great Mercies will I gather thee: In a little Wrath I hid my Face from thee for a moment; but with everlaſting Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs will I have Mercy on thee, ſaith the Lord.</hi> And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the Mercies of God to his Elect are, as himſelf is, eternall. As they ariſe from himſelf; ſo are they of interminable duration, as himſelf is. His Electing Mercy was before the World was; his Redeeming Mercy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we were; his Calling and quickening Mercy, when we <hi>were dead in Sins and Treſpaſſes;</hi> his Pardoning Mercy, when we have gone aſtray; his Confirming Mercy, when we are ready to ſlip; his Comforting Mercy, when we are ready to deſpair; his Raiſing Mercy, when we ſhall be returned to the Earth; his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and advancing Mercy, when we ſhall ſtand in Judgment, and have no other Plea for our ſelves but his free Mercy, when Time ſhall be no more.</p>
               <p>His Mercy therefore is indeficient, becauſe it helps us when we are in the loweſt Condition. We count
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:42122:109"/>him a ſure Friend, who fails us not when we are at the loweſt ebbe, in the greateſt Streights, in the extremeſt Neceſſity. And thus doth God, <hi>who remembred us in our low eſtate; for his Mercy endureth for ever,</hi> Pſalm 136.23. When our Preſſure is great, ſo as that the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy hath incloſed us, and we know not which way to eſcape, (as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> did the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> at the Red ſea,) even then he <hi>redeemeth us from our Enemies; for his Mercy endureth for ever,</hi> verſ. 24. Even then when we have none to help, he helps us. <hi>When he ſeeth</hi> his People's <hi>power gone, when there is none ſhut up or left, Deut.</hi> 32.36. when the Enemy is moſt inſolent, the Danger greateſt, our Hearts fail us, we deſpond and deſpair; when we ſay, <hi>Our way is hid from the Lord, and our Judgment paſſed over from our God;</hi> when we conclude that we are caſt out of the ſight of his eyes, and ſay with our Saviour, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> when in our own account we are <hi>free among the dead, like the ſlain that lie in the Grave, whom</hi> we think <hi>he remembers no more,</hi> but they <hi>are cut off from his hand:</hi> yet even then his Compaſſions fail not. They neither fail in their Duration, nor in their Conſtancy, nor in their Efficacy, nor in their Seaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs: but when there is a Neceſſity, when it is for his People's greateſt Advantage, they then appear ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually.</p>
               <p>Yea ſometimes, when we are inſenſible of our Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; when we are diſappointed of thoſe Supports we relied on; when we are out of Hope; when perhaps we are ſecure, and know not how near our Affliction is; when the Judgment comes in a way that is not perceivable; as when <hi>the Arrow</hi> of God <hi>flieth by day,</hi> and <hi>the Peſtilence walketh in darkneſs,</hi> and <hi>the Deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion waſteth at noon-day:</hi> In theſe and all other caſes, wherein there is no Help nor Deliverance but in and
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:42122:109"/>from God, yea when there is no reaſon to expect any, no not from God himſelf, yet even then his Compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions fail not, he comes in opportunely, and ſhews Mercy efficaciouſly. And therefore juſtly, in the next place,</p>

                  <hi>The Non-conſumption of God's People, their Salvation, is aſcribed by them to his indeficient Mercy onely, to his Compaſſions that fail not.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>David</hi> thus begins one of his Pſalms, (89.1, 2.) <hi>I will ſing of the Mercies of the Lord for ever: with my mouth will I make known thy Faithfulneſs to all genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. For I have ſaid, Mercy ſhall be built up for ever: thy Faithfulneſs ſhalt thou eſtabliſh in the very Heavens.</hi> And <hi>Pſal.</hi> 117. he ſaith, <hi>O praiſe the Lord, all ye Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; praiſe him, all ye People: for his mercifull Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is great towards us, and the Truth of the Lord endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth for ever. Praiſe ye the Lord.</hi> And the 136. <hi>Pſal.</hi> throughout is one continued Invitation to <hi>give Thanks to God, for his Mercy endureth for ever,</hi> 26 times repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Conſonant whereto is that of the Prophet <hi>Iſa.</hi> (63.7.) <hi>I will mention the Loving-kindneſſes of the Lord, and the Praiſes of the Lord, according to all that the Lord hath beſtowed on us, and the great Goodneſs towards the houſe of Iſrael, which he hath beſtowed on them, according to his Mercies, and according to the multitude of his Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving-kindneſſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the New Teſtament, the Bleſſed Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> in her <hi>Magnificat</hi> ſings thus; <hi>My Soul doth magnify the Lord,</hi> for that <hi>his Mercy is on them that fear him, from generation to generation. He hath holpen his ſervant Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, in remembrance of his Mercy,</hi> Luk. 1.46, 50, 54. <hi>Zacharias,</hi> in his <hi>Benedictus, Bleſſed be the Lord God
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:42122:110"/>of Iſrael, for he hath viſited and redeemed his people; to perform the Mercy promiſed to our Fathers,</hi> verſ. 68, 72. <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> was <hi>to give knowledge of Salvation un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his People, by the Remiſſion of their Sins, through the tender Mercy of our God,</hi> verſ. 77, 78.</p>
               <p>In a word, this was the main in the holy Songs of the Miniſters of the Temple, <hi>to give thanks to the Lord, becauſe his Mercy endureth for ever,</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16.41. And in like manner <hi>Jehoſaphat, when he had conſulted with the people, appointed Singers unto the Lord, and that ſhould praiſe the Beauty of Holineſs, as they went out before the Army, and to ſay, Praiſe the Lord, for his mercy endureth for ever,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20.21.</p>
               <p>And the ſame Commemoration of God's Mercy is the practice and delight of them that have a Spirit of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in all Generations. They write <hi>[Ex dono Dei]</hi> on all they have: they aſcribe all they doe to Mercy: all their Proſperity, Victory, Succeſs, they account as Mercies from God. When they caſt up the Inventory of their Good things they have enjoyed, all that they poſſeſs, the Summe totall is, innumerable Mercies. <hi>How precious are thy thoughts unto me, O God? how great is the ſumme of them? If I ſhould count them, they are more in number then the Sand,</hi> Pſalm 139.17, 18.</p>
               <p>The Law of Gratitude (then which none is more equal) ties every one to magnify God's Mercy. <hi>What hath</hi> any <hi>which he hath not received?</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.7. And who can look upon his Receipts as due Wages, and not rather pure Alms? Who hath not received loads of Benefits from God, and all out of pure Mercy? Our Forming in the womb is a prime Mercy, our Birth, our Education, our Inſtruction, our Preſervation, our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. That I be not infinite in this Account, Our Life, Breath, and all our Ways, all our natural Parts
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:42122:110"/>and Abilities, all our Motions and Proceedings, all our Eſcapes from Dangers, from Sickneſſes, from Death, and moſt of all from being a Prey to the Devil, and our Deliverance from Hell, are Evidences of tranſcendent Mercy in God, which all God's people are ſenſible of.

               </p>
               <p>The greatneſs of God's Mercies encouraged <hi>David</hi> to caſt himſelf <hi>into God's hand, rather then to fall into the hands of men,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.14.

               </p>
               <p>Not one of all the Holy Saints in all the Bible hath ever dared to utter ſuch Expreſſions to God or men, as if they could challenge the leaſt Relief in Trouble,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:42122:111" rendition="simple:additions"/>the leaſt Abatement of Sufferings, much leſs eternall Life and Reward in Heaven, upon account of their own Merit, as Phariſaicall Self-Juſtitiaries have preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to doe. Holy <hi>Jacob,</hi> on the contrary, (<hi>Gen.</hi> 32.10.) tells God, <hi>I am not worthy of the leaſt of all thy Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and of all the Truth which thou haſt ſhewed unto thy ſervant.</hi> And <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> when he allegeth his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings for God, <hi>Neh.</hi> 13.22. thus beſpeaks him; <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member me, O my God, concerning this alſo, and ſpare me according to the greatneſs of thy Mercy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is the Plea of all upright humble Souls; this is the <hi>Anchora ſacra,</hi> the ſure Anchour upon which their Spirits are ſtayed in all their Fluctuations; this is that Gale of wind which carries them on comfortably in all their Voiages.

               <p>It was thought by God no ſmall Mercy to <hi>Baruch,</hi> when the common Calamity <hi>added Grief to his Sorrow,</hi> when <hi>he fainted in his Sighing, and found no Reſt,</hi> to give him his Life. <hi>Behold, I will bring Evill upon all fleſh, ſaith the Lord; but thy Life will I give unto thee for a Prey in all places whither thou goeſt,</hi> Jer. 45.5.</p>
               <p>And ſhould you not count it a great Mercy to you, that in this common and ſore Judgment, in which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps you have loſt Wives, Husbands, Children, Friends, Neighbours, Goods, in which you have been filled with Fears, oppreſſed with Griefs, that yet you are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed; that yet the whole City, the whole Land is not conſumed; that yet our King, our Nobles, our Teachers, our Government, our Glory is not buried in perpetual Oblivion?</p>

            <p n="1">I. His Commemoration; which is of a Deliverance, and that from Death, and that of Himſelf, and that by God.</p>
            <p>All Deliverances are memorable things. As the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil eſcaped is grievous; ſo the Evaſion is joyous. Whence it is, that men love to tell of their Preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from Dangers, and to keep Memorials of them, and expreſs their Gratitude towards the Means whereby they avoid them.</p>
            <q>Navita ſecurus narrare pericula gaudet.</q>
            <p>The Mariner, preſerved from Shipwreck, loves to tell of his Dangers: the Souldier, that is ſafe after Fight, to talk of his Encounters. And the greater the Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger hath been, the more freely do they diſcourſe of it: eſpecially if the Deliverance be compleat. For then there are likely Feſtivities, to make others partakers of their Joy; Monuments or Records, to prevent Oblivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:42122:114"/>and (if they have any ſenſe of God's Hand, any ſmack of Religion,) Vows and Offerings are made and performed to God. Thus did the affrighted Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; when, upon <hi>Jonah</hi>'s being thrown over-board, <hi>the Seaceaſed from her raging, they feared the Lord ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly, and offered a Sacrifice unto the Lord, and made Vows,</hi> Jonah 1.15, 16.</p>
            <p>And this was <hi>David</hi>'s practice here and elſewhere. He had fled from one Enemy, but was fallen into the hands of more: He was <hi>as if a man did fly from a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and a Bear met him; or went into the houſe, and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned his hand on the wall, and a Serpent bit him. Saul</hi> hated him out of fear, leſt he ſhould ſupplant him: the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> who had found him a terrible Enemy, could not but hate him, becauſe he had been the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of deſtroying them. In this great Streight, his onely Refuge is in his God: <hi>In God have I put my truſt,</hi> ſaith he, verſ. 11. <hi>I will not be afraid what Man can doe unto me.</hi> And being aſſured of his Preſervation, he adds, <hi>Thy Vows are upon me, O God; I will ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Praiſes unto thee,</hi> verſ. 12. The reaſon of which is in my Text, <hi>For thou haſt delivered my Soul from death.</hi> Whence you may perceive this Concluſion to flow naturally,</p>
            <div type="observation">

               <p>
                  <hi>That God's Deliverance of our Souls or Lives from death, ſhould engage us to perform our Vows made to God in our Danger, and to render Praiſes to him for our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This was <hi>David</hi>'s practice in all his Dangers, to make Supplication to God in the time of his Diſtreſs; to make Vows to God for the enforcing of his Prayers; and then to perform his Vows, and praiſe his Deliverer, when he was eſcaped.</p>
               <pb n="220" facs="tcp:42122:115"/>
               <p>The 116. <hi>Pſalm</hi> is very full to this purpoſe. There he tells us of his Danger, verſ. 3. <hi>The Sorrows of Death compaſſed me, and the Pains of Hell gat hold upon me.</hi> In this Extremity he applies himſelf to his ſacred Anchour, <hi>Then called I upon the Name of the Lord; O Lord, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech thee, deliver my Soul,</hi> verſ. 4. The Event is, <hi>he was brought low, and God helped him,</hi> verſ. 6. he called upon the Lord, and he heard him. Therefore he beſpeaks his Soul, <hi>Return unto thy Reſt, O my Soul; for the Lord hath dealt bountifully with thee,</hi> verſ. 7. Therefore he <hi>loves the Lord,</hi> conſults <hi>what he may render to the Lord for all his Benefits towards him,</hi> chiefly for <hi>deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering his Soul from death:</hi> and he reſolves to <hi>take the Cup of Salvation, and to call upon the Name of the Lord;</hi> to <hi>pay his Vows in the preſence of all his people,</hi> verſ. 13, 14. to <hi>offer the Sacrifice of Thanksgiving,</hi> verſ. 17. to tell of all God's works with gladneſs, and to make others to be partakers of his Joy. He invites the Godly to hear the Narrative of God's Mercies towards him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 66.16. <hi>Come and hear, all ye that fear God, and I will declare what he hath done for my Soul.</hi> And in a word, He uſes all the ways he can, to demonſtrate his ſenſe of God's Goodneſs to him, to keep a Memorial of his Loving-kindneſſes, to affect others with his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments; that both he and all others (as much as in him lay) might be moved to pray unto, to truſt in, to praiſe and obey God, as one that <hi>delivereth from death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The like Inſtance we have <hi>Iſa.</hi> 38. concerning <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiah.</hi> A Meſſage was brought to him, that he ſhould die: He betakes himſelf to Prayer, turns his face to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Wall, and weeps: God hears his Prayer, ſees his Tears, adds to his days fifteen years: Being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, he writes an Hymn of Praiſe, ſets out his Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and Deliverance, with his Reſolution to praiſe God all his days in the moſt ſolemn manner he was able.</p>
               <pb n="221" facs="tcp:42122:115"/>
               <p>Even the Light of Nature taught the ſame to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners, <hi>Jonah</hi> 1.16. All people whatſoever, that have acknowledged a God, have ſtill aſcribed their Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances from Death to their God, and have ſtill perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med their <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or Thank-offerings, to their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ities upon their Preſervation. Nor was this done by them without great and juſt Reaſons.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For firſt, Death is the chief of all Evils: it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prives of all Good. <hi>Omnia appetunt Bonum,</hi> ſaith the Philoſopher in the beginning of his Ethicks; It's na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural to all to deſire their own Good. Beaſts will ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle much with the Slayer, before they will die. <hi>Skin for skin, and all that a man hath will he give for his Life.</hi> The moſt ſickly, needy perſon, would fain preſerve his Life. Death is moſt reſiſted, as the moſt terrible. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture apprehends it as the Privation of all Good.</p>
               <p>Even our Lord <hi>Chriſt</hi> would fain have had <hi>this Cup paſs from him,</hi> and therefore <hi>in the days of his Fleſh, he offered up Prayers and Supplications, with ſtrong Crying and Tears, unto him that was able to ſave him from Death, Heb.</hi> 5.7. Though he had no Sin of his own to gall his Conſcience, yet he had a natural ſenſe of the Evil of Death, and earneſtly deſired Deliverance from it. The Being he had as a Man he ſo prized, that if his Father's Will had not engaged him to it, he would never have parted with it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Life is ſweet; it is a pleaſant thing to behold the Sun:</hi> but there is <hi>Bitterneſs in Death,</hi> as the King of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malekites</hi> ſpeaks, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.32. Many Circumſtances make it indeed more bitter to ſome then others: yet to all it hath its exceeding Bitterneſs. <hi>O Death,</hi> (ſaith the Son of <hi>Sirach</hi>) <hi>how bitter is the Remembrance of thee to the man that liveth at reſt in his poſſeſſions, unto the man that hath nothing to vex him, and that hath Proſperity in all things, yea unto him that is yet able to receive meat!</hi> Ecclus. 41.1.</p>
               <pb n="222" facs="tcp:42122:116"/>
               <p>I deny not but ſome, to avoid the fury of Tyrants, have killed themſelves; yet not without fretting and indignation. Some to gain an immortal Name, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers by Satanical Deluſions or Philoſophicall Charms, have of themſelves embraced Death: but I cannot ſay they have done it without any Reluctancy at all; though to avoid a worſe Evil, or obtain a better Good, (as they conceived,) they have parted with their Lives.</p>
               <p>There were ſome Circumſtances which might have made Death more bitter at this time to <hi>David,</hi> then it was to him when he <hi>fell aſleep, and was gathered to his Fathers.</hi> To be killed in the Land of the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> by the hands of the Uncircumciſed, when he fled from <hi>Saul</hi> out of ſome diſtruſt of God's Preſervation in his own Country; to have died with the Diſappointment of his hopes of being King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to which he was anointed by <hi>Samuel,</hi> and had God's Promiſe for it; had been a greater Grievance, then to die in his Bed, <hi>full of days, and in a good old age.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Violent Deaths and dying by peſtilential Diſeaſes are the more terrible, in regard a perſon is then deprived of all Help, Society, Conference with others; all ſhun him (even his neareſt Relations) as an inſtrument of Death, when dying, he kills others with his Breath; his Plague-ſore takes away the Life of his Child, whoſe Life he prizeth above his own; the Life of his Friend, yea his Wife, that is as his own Soul. Theſe and many other ſuch Concomitants of Death do make it more dreadfull to a man.</p>
               <p>But there is yet ſomething beſides that makes it moſt terrible. The Conſideration that <hi>Death is the Wages of Sin</hi> adds greater weight to the preſſure of Death: for then Death becomes not onely the Burthen of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, but alſo of the Spirit. While the Back is whole, it
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:42122:116"/>will bear much: but when the Skin is flayed off, or the Shoulder-blade broken, then to have a Load laid on the Back, is intolerable. So it is in the caſe of Death: When there is Peace of Conſcience, it is not ſo heavy news, but that Faith and a good Conſcience can bear the tidings of it: but when Death is preſented as the Fruit not onely of the firſt Sin of Man, but alſo of our own particular Sins, ſo as Conſcience tells a man, My Exceſs in Drinking hath ſhortened my Life, I have haſtened my Death by my Riot and Intemperance, by my Quarrelling, my Diſloyalty, my Eagerneſs to get Wealth, by my Wilfulneſs and Raſhneſs in venturing into infected houſes, by a pragmatick humour in med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dling with that which did not concern me, by theſe and ſuch like practices; Oh then how doth Death <hi>bite as a Serpent, and ſting as an Adder! The Sting of Death is Sin,</hi> when it lies on the Conſcience: it kills as a Scorpion; tortures as well as kills; makes <hi>a Fire in the bones;</hi> kindles Hell-fire in the Soul.</p>
               <p>Eſpecially when the Soul remembers how Sin hath been committed preſumptuouſly with an high hand, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Inſtructions of Parents, Warnings of Friends, Admonitions of Preachers, Offers of Grace, Invitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to Repentance: that all theſe have been ſlighted, and even the Goſpel of <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath been neglected: that the Sin remains unpardoned: that after the <hi>firſt Death</hi> the <hi>ſecond Death</hi> is expected, after Death Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment follows, which uſhers in Wrath and Vengeance.</p>
               <p>When the Conſcience of Unmercifulneſs, Neglect of the poor Members of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> waſting our Eſtate in Lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ury, ſpending our precious Time in vanities, (which ſhould have been employed in Prayer, and other ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Exerciſes and Meditations, and in Self-examination,) flies in our Faces, frights us like the ſight of Furies; when the thought of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Coming to Judgment, of
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:42122:117"/>that dreadfull Sentence, <hi>Goe, ye curſed, into everlaſting fire, prepared for the Devill and his Angels,</hi> ſtill runs in our mind; then is Death <hi>the King of Terrours.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The man not onely ſings <hi>Adrian</hi>'s Ditty, <hi>Animula, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gula, blandula, Hoſpes Coméſque Corporis, Quae nunc abibis in loca?</hi> but he <hi>roars out for the Diſquietneſs of his Soul;</hi> and cries out with <hi>Cain, My Puniſhment,</hi> or <hi>Iniquity, is greater then I can bear.</hi> Then will he wiſh <hi>the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains and Rocks</hi> to <hi>fall on</hi> him, <hi>and hide</hi> him <hi>from the Face of him that ſitteth upon the Throne, and from the Wrath of the Lamb: For the great day of his Wrath is come, and who is able to ſtand?</hi> Rev. 6.16, 17.</p>
               <p>Now then Deliverance from Death muſt needs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve Praiſe and Thankſgiving: Deliverance from the greateſt Evil ſhould be received with the greateſt Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude. Deliverance from natural Death cauſeth Holy perſons to bleſs God: but Deliverance from Sin, (the cauſe of Death,) from <hi>the Wrath to come,</hi> (eternal Death,) much more. This makes the Deliverance moſt compleat, and the Thankfulneſs ſhould be moſt ample. To which is to be added,</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the Deliverance is by God: it is He that <hi>delivers the Soul from Death.</hi> Now what comes from God's hand is moſt acceptable to them that love God. A Deliverance from Death by a man doth ingage our Affections to him: we think our ſelves obliged to him while we live, who hath preſerved our Life; eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if he be a perſon of great Quality. To have our Lives ſaved by the King whom we had provoked, to be pardoned our Treaſon, exceedingly heightens our valuation of the Benefit.</p>
               <p>There is much more cauſe to magnifie the Goodneſs of God, who ſaves his people from Death by pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of their Sins, by advancing them to Nearneſs with himſelf; who ſo ſaves from Death temporal, as to give
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:42122:117"/>Life eternal. <hi>Behold,</hi> ſaith <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> (Iſa. 38.17.) <hi>for Peace, I had great Bitterneſs: but thou haſt in love to my Soul delivered it from the Pit; for thou haſt caſt all my Sins behind thy back.</hi> The Forgiveneſs of Sins (which occaſioned Death) is a greater Benefit then the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing of Life: And then it is Happineſs accumulated to the height, when there is not onely length of days on Earth, but eternal Life in Heaven conferred upon the ſaved.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bleſs the Lord, O my Soul,</hi> ſaith <hi>David,</hi> (Pſal. 103.1, 2, 3, 4.) <hi>and all that is within me, bleſs his holy Name. Bleſs the Lord, O my Soul, and forget not all his Benefits: Who forgiveth all thy Sins, and healeth all thy Diſeaſes; Who redeemeth thy life from deſtruction, and crowneth thee with Loving-kindneſs and tender Mercies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All which Mercies are the more joyfull to the belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Soul, becauſe they are not ſo much the fruit of our Prayers, as of God's free Grace in <hi>Chriſt. The God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt ſo loved the World,</hi> the ſinfull World, <hi>even when they were Enemies</hi> to him, <hi>that he gave his onely-begotten Son to death, even the death of the Croſs, that whoſoever believeth on him ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting Life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Deliverance from Death proceeding from God's ſpecial Love, that <hi>great Love wherewith he loved us,</hi> when <hi>we were dead in Treſpaſſes and Sins, quickening us together with Chriſt, ſaving us by Grace,</hi> is that which makes it incomprehenſibly welcome, and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rageth the Soul to expect farther Preſervation; as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> doth here: which brings me to the Second Part of my Text, now to be handled, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">II. <hi>David</hi>'s Poſtulation; <hi>Wilt thou not deliver my Feet from falling?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Expreſſion ſeems to be expoſtulatory, but is to be conceived to include a Petition. He demands of
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:42122:118"/>God, <hi>Wilt thou not,</hi> &amp;c? not as one that challenged it as his due deſert, but as aſſured of the Continuance of God's Goodneſs. He deprehends in God a Fountain of Love, which is ſtill running over, flowing down in far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Streams of ſaving Mercy.</p>
               <p>We have an exact and ample Paraphraſe upon the words of my Text in that paſſage, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 36. from verſ. 5. to the end, where, having ſet out the Wickedneſs of men, and his own Danger, he breaks forth in extolling God's Goodneſs, in an aſſurance of a conſtant Current of Mercies; and then is inſtant with God for the Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of his Preſervation.</p>
               <p>This part of my Text is a moſt precious paſſage, of great Uſe for your Meditation in times of Danger by reaſon of Peſtilence or War; and it ſhews this to be the cuſtomary practice of Holy perſons, to gather Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Aſſurance of future Help from God, from their experience of his former gracious Deliverances. So did <hi>David:</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17.37. when he was to fight wïth <hi>Goliah,</hi> he argued thus, <hi>The Lord that delivered me out of the Paw of the Lion and of the Bear, he will deliver me out of the hand of this Philiſtine.</hi> And after him S. <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.9, 10. <hi>We had the ſentence of death in our ſelves, that we ſhould not truſt in our ſelves, but in God that raiſeth the dead; Who delivered us from ſo great a death, and doth deliver: in whom we truſt, that he will yet deliver.</hi> In his former Deliverance he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Power of God, that he could deliver from Death: he deprehends his watchfulneſs over him, in the Continuance of his Deliverance, his Love to him and Care of him: which confirms him in the expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of farther Help for the future.</p>
               <p>As they ſay all Vertues are concatenate in Prudence: ſo all Mercies are linked together in God's Love and Care of his Servants. And indeed ſo the Apoſtle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrs,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:42122:118"/>
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.32. <hi>He that ſpared not his own Son, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered him up for us all, how ſhall he not with him alſo freely give us all things?</hi> He that preſerves our Lives, will keep our Feet. <hi>Thou haſt delivered my Soul from Death: wilt thou not alſo deliver my Feet from falling?</hi> Surely thou wilt.</p>
               <p>But then this Deliverance muſt be ſought for at his hands; which is alſo implied in this Expreſſion. When <hi>Chriſt</hi> cured the lame Cripple, he bade him <hi>take up his bed, and walk.</hi> God, when he ſaves our Life from death, expects that we ſhould walk before him. Our Life is a Pilgrimage; we walk from one Stage of it to another: as the Sun runs its courſe, ſo doth Man. The Emanations of our Minds, the Actions of our Members, are our Steps. If we walk not uprightly, if we heed not what we think, what we ſpeak, what we act, our Feet will quickly fall, firſt into Sin, and then into Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief. The Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.2. tells us out of his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of himſelf, that <hi>his Feet were almoſt gone, his Steps had well-nigh ſlipt.</hi> He had ſtumbled at the Stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling-ſtone, to wit, <hi>the Proſperity of the Wicked:</hi> This begat <hi>Envy</hi> in him; and that drew him on to a kind of Affection to their ways, to a condemning of his own Courſe, and <hi>offending againſt the generation of God's Children.</hi> And had not God mercifully caught him when he was falling, by directing him to <hi>the Sanctuary of God,</hi> where he might <hi>ſee the End</hi> of the wicked, (that however they ſtood on ſmooth, yet they were but <hi>ſlippery places;</hi> they walked on Ice, which would ſuddenly break under them, and then they would ſink for ever,) he had certainly periſhed. Therefore he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers himſelf, and applies himſelf to God, verſ. 23, 24. and ſtays himſelf on the <hi>Manutenentia Divina; Thou haſt holden me by my right hand: Thou wilt guide me with thy Counſel, and after receive me to Glory.</hi>

                  <hi>As for me,</hi> (ſaith he in another Pſalm, 41.12.) <hi>thou upholdeſt me in mine Integrity, and ſetteſt me before thy face for ever.</hi> Faith in God's ſuſtaining Grace is the onely ſure Preſervative againſt falling into Sin, and thereby into Miſery. <hi>Thou wilt keep him in perfect Peace whoſe mind is ſtayed on thee, becauſe he truſteth in thee,</hi> ſaith the Prophet <hi>Iſa.</hi> (26.3.) <hi>He that truſteth in his own Heart is a fool: but whoſo walketh wiſely ſhall be delivered,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon,</hi> Prov. 28.26. He that leaneth on his own Free will, his own good Purpoſes, his own Reaſon, his own good Merits, ſhall be ſure to fall. S. <hi>Peter,</hi> when he was confident of his own Strength, that he ſhould die rather then deny his Maſter, (and was ſo venturous thereupon as to go into the High Prieſt's Palace,) was ſo affrighted with the words of a Maid, that he not onely denied him, but forſwore him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iſrael, which followed after the Law of Righteouſneſs, attained not to the Law of Righteouſneſs. Wherefore? Becauſe they ſought it not by Faith, but as it were by the Works of the Law: for they ſtumbled at the Stumbling-ſtone,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.31, 32.</p>
               <p>We are like little Children, we love to be on our Feet, not knowing our own Weakneſs: and then we venture without God to guide and ſtay us, and ſo we fall and wound our ſelves. Our ſafeſt way is to diſtruſt our ſelves, to <hi>work out our Salvation with fear and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling;</hi> as knowing that it is <hi>God that worketh in us to will and to doe, of his good pleaſure,</hi> Phil. 2.12, 13.

You that are here now alive may ſay, <hi>God hath delivered your Souls from Death.</hi> I wiſh I might ſay truly, that God hath delivered your Souls from <hi>the Death of Sin;</hi> that God hath given you <hi>Repentance un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Life;</hi> that you were none of you ſuch as ſhould <hi>die in your Sins,</hi> but by believing in <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhould ſee <hi>the light of Life.</hi> I wiſh that he were to you <hi>the Reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and the Life:</hi> ſo that <hi>though you were dead, yet you might live;</hi> that <hi>living and believing in him, you might never die,</hi> as our Saviour ſaid to <hi>Martha,</hi> Joh. 11.25, 26. I hope the beſt of you. However, while you are yet alive, (eſpecially you that have been in danger by reaſon of the Contagion of late,) endeavour to walk in the ſteps of <hi>David.</hi> Remember what your Prayers were in your Perils; what Vows and Promiſes you made, when you expected Death; what Perplexity and Anxiety ſeized on you, when the Remembrance of your Sins filled you with Horrour; when you loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked for Death to attack you, and caſt your Body into the Grave, and perhaps your Soul into Hell; when you expected a Summons to the Bar of God's Judgment, there to be tried, and to have your Doom paſſed on you. Call to mind (I beſeech you) what ſecret Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, what Purpoſes you had; what paſs'd between God and your Souls in thoſe Streights you were in. And then reſolve, as <hi>David</hi> did here, to addreſs your ſelves to God, as he did, ſaying, <hi>Thy Vows are upon me, O God; I will render Praiſes unto thee, for thou haſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered my Soul from Death.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="230" facs="tcp:42122:120"/>
               <p>O remember what God hath done for you, in giving you your Lives, in <hi>bringing you back from the depth of the Earth again.</hi> When <hi>thouſands have fallen on your right hand</hi> and on your left hand, yet the Evil <hi>hath not come nigh you.</hi> If it have entred into your Houſes, ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on your Perſons; yet it hath not taken away your Breath: ſo that though <hi>the Lord hath chaſtened you ſore, yet he hath not given you over unto Death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Chiefly, if God have <hi>awakened you that ſlept,</hi> that you might <hi>ſtand up from the dead,</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> might <hi>give you light;</hi> O then rejoyce in God's Goodneſs to you: let the Remembrance of it make the Thoughts of God delightfull to you; quicken you to <hi>run the ways of his Commandments;</hi> mind you to perform the great Duties of Reformation of your Lives, and new Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to God that preſerved you, according to all the Vows, Reſolutions and Engagements which were upon you when you were in Trouble.</p>
               <p>Yea, if you were then inſenſible of your Condition, and thought not on the accurſed eſtate which would have befallen you if you had died in your Sins; now at leaſt begin to lay it to heart. Sure, though you have eſcaped out of the hands of Death now, yet it will overtake you at laſt: All the means you can uſe, all the Advantages, all the Privileges you have, cannot avoid it, or exempt you from going the way of all fleſh.</p>
               <p>Oh then that you would now become in your Life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, what you would willingly be found to be at the hour of Death. If you would not be found of Death Swearing, Lying, Deceiving, or engaged in any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly and unrighteous way; then be not ſo now. If you would then be found Praying, Meditating on God's Word, Praiſing God; inure your ſelves to ſuch Exerciſes now. It will not be eaſie to doe it then, if you be not accuſtomed to it now. You will then have
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:42122:120"/>the Comfort of a happy Death, if you be acquainted with the practice of a holy Life now.</p>
               <p>If your Remembrance of God's Goodneſs towards you puts you on ſuch Reſolutions, the Remembrance that you have <hi>taſted how gracious the Lord is,</hi> how he hath <hi>redeemed your Souls from the nethermoſt Hell,</hi> by the Bloud of his Son, (which you are to remember with the greateſt Thankfulneſs, when you come to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Holy Communion,) and preſerves you from the <hi>ſecond Death;</hi> you will then be animated to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of God, that he will <hi>keep your Feet from falling.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Take heed that you ſtumble not at the Proſperity of the wicked, ſo as to approve and chuſe their ways. Take heed that <hi>Chriſt</hi> be not <hi>a Stone of Stumbling and a Rock of Offence</hi> to you; that you ſtumble not at the Word, disbelieving the Goſpel, being diſobedient to the Precepts of the Word: leſt ye be <hi>appointed unto Wrath,</hi> and not <hi>to obtain Salvation through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Take heed of ordering your Steps by your own Reaſon, by the imagined Light within you; which is for the moſt part an <hi>Ignis fatuus,</hi> a dangerous Meteor, that will bring you into Pits and Bogs. Take heed of truſting to your own Free will, your own good Purpoſes: they will prove but <hi>a broken Reed, which, when you lean on them, will run into your hands, and pierce them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Get your <hi>Feet ſhod with the</hi> Shoes of <hi>the Preparation,</hi> or (as it may be well read) <hi>the Pavement, of the Goſpel of Peace,</hi> as firm ground upon which you may ſtand; not your own Good works, or your own Merits.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As you have received Chriſt Jeſus the Lord, ſo walk in him; rooted and built up in him, and eſtabliſhed in the Faith, as ye have been taught, abounding therein with Thanksgiving:</hi> as the Apoſtle exhorteth, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 2.6, 7. Still pray that God would <hi>keep your Feet from falling,</hi>
                  <pb n="232" facs="tcp:42122:121"/>and <hi>order your Steps in his Word, that no Iniquity get dominion over you.</hi> And then you may with aſſurance ſay, <hi>I ſhall not die, but live, and declare the Works of the Lord:</hi> and you ſhall obtain <hi>David</hi>'s deſire, to <hi>walk be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God in the light of the living.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But ſure we walk contrary to God in the Darkneſs of this World; elſe why is it that God hath <hi>called to contend againſt us by Fire?</hi> It was not long agoe, that we rejoyced becauſe we had prevailed upon the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; and now the Scene is altered, and we mourn be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Fire hath prevailed upon our houſes at Land. Sure we <hi>rejoyced</hi> not <hi>with trembling;</hi> we were ſenſible of God's Hand on others, but not ſenſible we deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved his Indignation on our ſelves.</p>
               <p>God warned us by Signs in the Heavens, but we a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended not; he ſent the Peſtilence, but we reformed not; we were embroiled in War, but nothing bette<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; Preachers cried out againſt our Sins, but we cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not to God for Pardon; <hi>the Lord's voice cried to the City,</hi> but we were not <hi>men of wiſedom,</hi> to <hi>ſee his Name.</hi> Our Sins cried to Heaven for Vengeance, and the Lord's Vengeance hath from Heaven fallen upon us. We obſerved days of Faſting formally, but did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally <hi>repent in Duſt and Aſhes;</hi> and now God hath real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reduced our Great City unto Duſt, and turned it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Aſhes.</p>
               <p>Hath not God by his Judgment, reſembling that of <hi>Sodom,</hi> pointed out the Sins which procured this Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Pride, Fulneſs of bread, abundance of Idleneſs; not ſtrengthening the hands of the poor and needy;</hi> Wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſs and Unrighteouſneſs? Were not the <hi>Souls</hi> of many (as <hi>Lot</hi>'s in <hi>Sodom</hi>) <hi>vexed from day to day in hearing and ſeeing</hi> mens <hi>unrighteous deeds and wicked converſation;</hi> perhaps <hi>having a Form of Godlineſs, but denying the Power of it?</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="233" facs="tcp:42122:121"/>
               <p>But are we better then they? Are we not <hi>all under Sin,</hi> liable to the ſame Condemnation? We may, we ought to bemoan the Calamity which is come on o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. The lifting up of God's Hand ſhould affright us, the Blow of his Hand on our Brethren ſhould af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict us. We, out of Sympathy with them, out of Dread of God's Anger, ſhould <hi>bewail the Burning which the Lord hath kindled.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jeremiah</hi>'s Lamentations are ſutable to this Occaſion. We may take up thoſe Wailings, <hi>Alas! Alas!</hi> our <hi>great</hi> Neighbour-<hi>City</hi> is burnt, in a ſhort time <hi>is her Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But that which moſt befits us, which is moſt likely to benefit us and them, is, to be affected with God's Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitation; to look upon this as a Forerunner of a greater Fire, <hi>magnum futuri Judicii Praeindicium, an Example</hi> of <hi>the Vengeance of eternal Fire.</hi> Let us be awakened by it out of our Security, as conſidering that we have the like Sins, and may expect the like Puniſhment; that God's Burning there is our Warning here; that however it were in reſpect of men, yet in reſpect of God it is as a Beacon fired to alarm us, that we may <hi>prepare to meet our God</hi> by Faſting and Prayer, and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment of life, leſt, <hi>if we repent not, we likewiſe pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh.</hi> It becomes us not to be Cenſurers of others, but to <hi>judge our ſelves,</hi> that <hi>we be not judged:</hi> we muſt not inſult over them, but pity them. If we have our Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes ſpared, it is that we may receive them that are deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute: if our Goods be preſerved, it is that their Wants may be ſupplied.</p>
               <p>In a word, we ſhould take heed of <hi>Edom</hi>'s Sin, who <hi>rejoyced in the day of Jeruſalem's Calamity:</hi> take heed of promiſing to our ſelves increaſe of Trade, or other worldly Advantages: moſt of all, take heed of Flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring our ſelves, as if we were better, more ſafe, more
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:42122:122"/>in God's Favour then they. Let us rather fear God's Judgments, tremble at his Word, ſearch our own ways, turn unto the Lord with our whole Souls, pray for them that have ſuffered, help them what we can; that their Breach may be repaired, our Tranquillity may be lengthened, and our Souls delivered from the Wrath to come. Which the Lord vouchſafe for his Son's ſake. <hi>Amen.</hi>

            <p>AS God is the <hi>Alpha,</hi> the Beginning of all things; ſo he is the <hi>Omega</hi> or End of all things: as he is <hi>the Father of Lights, from whom every good and perfect Gift cometh;</hi> ſo ſhould he be the Scope of our Lives, as he was here of <hi>David</hi>'s: according to the laſt Particular obſerved in this Text of Scripture, <hi>viz.</hi>

            <p n="3">III. The Aim and End of <hi>David</hi> in his Commemora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Poſtulation; <hi>That I may walk before thee in the light of the living.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this End he both commemorates what God had already done for him, in <hi>delivering his Soul from Death;</hi> and petitions, with expectation of ſpeeding, that he would yet doe more for him, in <hi>keeping his Feet from falling.</hi> He doth not deſire this Stability of his Feet, that he might ſit ſtill, or ſluggiſhly keep his Bed, or lie on his Couch; but that he might <hi>walk.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Walking</hi> naturally is a progreſſive motion of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy from one place to another, performed by the Feet, with the help and direction of the Eyes, for the acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring or effecting ſomething. And it connotes a Way, in which a perſon is to walls; and a <hi>Terminus ad quem,</hi> to which it tends.</p>
            <p>By this Metaphor of <hi>Walking</hi> the Scripture under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands the Motions of the Mind and Actings of the Members, as they are ſubject to a Rule; which is the Way in which a perſon walks. If it be right, it is God's Law: if it be wrong, it is the Devices of mens own <hi>Minds,</hi> the way of a man's own Heart, or <hi>the Courſe of the World,</hi> or the Wiles of <hi>Satan;</hi> which are mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned as the crooked ways men <hi>walk in,</hi> Eph. 2.2, 3. All theſe are ways of Darkneſs, wherein men depart from God, and walk after Satan. But <hi>David</hi>'s Aim is, to <hi>walk before God in the light of the living.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Walking before God</hi> here denotes not onely a doing or thinking ſo, as that the Action or Thought would ſtill be in God's preſence; as if <hi>David</hi> meant no more then this, that God would ſee him, or his Walk would be in his ſight, whether he would or no: But it means alſo ſuch a Walking before God, as to eye his preſence, what-ever he ſhould doe or think, with an aim to pleaſe him. And therefore <hi>walking before God</hi> is rendred of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, <hi>pleaſing God:</hi> as when it is ſaid, <hi>Gen.</hi> 5.24. <hi>Enoch walked with God,</hi> in the <hi>Greek</hi> it is, <hi>Enoch pleaſed God;</hi> which the Authour to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> follows, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.5. <hi>Enoch before his Tranſlation had this Teſtimony, that he pleaſed God.</hi> And ſo it notes not onely his apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of God's entitative Preſence, or his Tuition or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding him, but alſo his pleaſing God in his Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, having a regard to his Approbation, out of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to obtain his Favour, as well as to his Power, to avoid his Anger. As S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith of himſelf, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.17.
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:42122:123"/>
               <hi>We are not as many, which corrupt the Word of God; but as of Sincerity, but as of God, in the ſight of God ſpeak we in Chriſt:</hi> and Chap. 4.2. <hi>commending our ſelves to every man's Conſcience in the ſight of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is ſomewhat more alſo, I think, in this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, <hi>viz.</hi> That his Aim was to walk before God by worſhipping at the Tabernacle; for that place he means ſometimes when he ſpeaks of appearing before God: as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42.2. <hi>When ſhall I come, and appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God?</hi> the meaning of which longing is thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed <hi>Pſal.</hi> 43.3. <hi>O ſend out thy Light and thy Truth; let them lead me and bring me unto thy holy Hill, and to thy Tabernacle:</hi> and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 84.2. <hi>My Soul longeth, yea even fainteth for the Courts of the Lord: my Heart and my fleſh crieth out for the living God.</hi> And ſo it hath the ſame ſenſe with that of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> Iſa. 38.20. <hi>The Lord was ready to ſave me: therefore we will ſing my Songs to the ſtringed Inſtruments all the days of our life in the houſe of the Lord.</hi> And then, <hi>in the light of the living,</hi> is all one with, all the time of his Life, or among the living; oppoſite to that which <hi>Hezekiah</hi> ſaid verſ. 18, 19. <hi>The Grave cannot praiſe thee, Death cannot celebrate thee, they that go down into the Pit cannot hope for thy truth. The Living, the Living, he ſhall praiſe thee, as I do this day: the Father to the Children ſhall make known thy Truth.</hi> And to this ſenſe is it which the Pſalmiſt here ſaith, <hi>I will walk before the Lord in the land of the living.</hi> So that hence ariſeth this</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>That a Godly man, when God delivers his Soul from Death, and his Feet from falling, aims at walking before God in the light of the living; as counting himſelf there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to engaged.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="238" facs="tcp:42122:124"/>
               <p>Indeed every Holy Chriſtian counts his Life due to God. <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.7, 8. <hi>None of us</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>liveth to himſelf, and no man dieth to himſelf: For whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we live, we live unto the Lord; and whether we die, we die unto the Lord: whether we live therefore or die, we are the Lord's.</hi> Every one that hath found God gracious to him, doeth as <hi>Enoch, Noah, Abraham,</hi> and all the Saints of old did, he walks before God, as coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his Life onely <hi>Vitam vitalem,</hi> a <hi>Life indeed,</hi> while he imploys it for God: otherwiſe, while he lives with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out God in the world, he counts himſelf to live a live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Life, to be <hi>dead while he lives.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now walking before God may be underſtood either Materially, and ſo all men walk before God: (his Eye is upon them; he <hi>knows their down-ſitting and their up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſing;</hi> he <hi>underſtandeth their Thoughts afar off;</hi> he <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſeth their path and their lying down, and is acquainted with all their ways. There is not a word in their Tongue but he knows it altogether,</hi> as it is <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139.2, 3, 4.) or Formally and reciprocally, ſo as that God is eyed by us; his Omnipreſence, Omniſcience, Omnipotency, are apprehended and obſerved by us, as the Pſalmiſt ſpeaks, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.8. <hi>I have ſet the Lord always before me: becauſe he is at my right hand, I ſhall not be moved.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This may be done either Speculatively, ſo as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template his Being, to enquire after him, to have ſome Apprehenſions of God: or Affectively, either ſo as to hate God, as the Devils and damned Spirits, that acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge God to be, but with <hi>trembling</hi> and horrour of Spirit, and againſt their wills, <hi>James</hi> 2.19. or ſo as to love God; <hi>If any love God, the ſame is known of him:</hi> or Practically, ſo as not onely to acknowledge him to be God, and to love him, but alſo relatively to own him as our God; as the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 48.14. <hi>This God is our God for ever and ever; he will be our Guide unto death.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="239" facs="tcp:42122:124"/>
               <p>This Walking before God comprehends the conſtant ordering the frame of our Actions for God. A man is not ſaid to walk, who makes but one Step: Walking imports a Continuation of Steps; and Walking before God, a Multiplication of Actions, and thoſe in God's way; as they ſaid, <hi>Mic.</hi> 4.2. <hi>He will teach us his ways, and we ſhall walk in his paths.</hi> For though all <hi>the ways of a man are before the eyes of the Lord, and he pondereth all his goings:</hi> yet he counts no Walking to be <hi>before him,</hi> but that which is <hi>in Holineſs and Righteouſneſs,</hi> as it is <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.75. There muſt be a removing from the oppoſite term, to wit, Satan. <hi>Some are already turned aſide after Satan,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.15. Thoſe cannot walk before God, that hold Intelligence with Satan. When <hi>Eve</hi> held Parley with the old Serpent, ſhe departed from God: and ſo did <hi>Saul,</hi> when he went after the Witch of <hi>Endor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And in like manner doe all that are <hi>conformed to this World,</hi> that are <hi>faſhioned after their own Luſts,</hi> that adhere to their own Reaſon. Familiarity with Satan, Conformity to this World, <hi>Reaſoning with fleſh and bloud,</hi> are inconſiſtent with <hi>walking before God.</hi> There muſt be a <hi>turning from Darkneſs to Light, and from the power of Satan unto God,</hi> as the words are <hi>Act.</hi> 26.18. God muſt be the <hi>Terminus ad quem,</hi> he to whom we come, as it is <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.6. <hi>He that cometh unto God muſt believe that he is, and that he is a Rewarder of them that diligently ſeek him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this Walking is not, when we onely doe ſome Actions in God's way. A man is not ſaid to <hi>walk be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God,</hi> that ſometimes is in God's way, and then skips out of it again: ſuch Going in and out is not Walking, but running counter; like <hi>the way of a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent upon a Stone,</hi> dancing, leaping, and frisking. Then a man is ſaid to walk to a place or perſon, not when
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:42122:125"/>he doth make a Vagarie or two, but keeps on in an uniform, ſettled, even pace, hath his eye upon the Mark, and follows after it wittingly, willingly, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly; when he doth, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.16. go on gradually, orderly, <hi>by the ſame Rule</hi> that the Apoſtles and other Holy perſons have heretofore gone by. A man cannot come to God <hi>per Saltum,</hi> by a Leap; but by a conſtant regular Courſe of actions, propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to himſelf God as the Object unto whom he directs his Actions, and his Motive for what he doeth.</p>
               <p>And herein there muſt be two things eſpecally eyed by us: to wit,</p>
               <p n="1">1. God's Sovereignty and Almightineſs. <hi>I am the Almighty God,</hi> ſaith God to <hi>Abraham,</hi> Gen. 17.1. <hi>walk before me, and be thou perfect.</hi> The Fear and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence of God as the Supreme Majeſty, as he that is <hi>Maximus,</hi> the Greateſt, ſhould attract our Eyes and our Hearts towards him with Awfulneſs: as Subjects compoſe and order their Carriage with Awe and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to their Sovereign, becauſe he is their Lord; attiring themſelves ſutable to his Dignity, ſo as not to diſgrace him by their ſlovenly Habits.

                  </gap>, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.13. that is, in good faſhion, <hi>decently</hi> or <hi>honeſtly,</hi> (as we would ſay, and our Tranſlation reads it,) after the Court-faſhion of Heaven. We ſhould walk before God in white, like the heavenly Courtiers, <hi>cloathed with white Linen, fine and clean, which is the Righteouſneſs of Saints,</hi> Rev. 19.8. that is, with holy Habits and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions of mind. They that walk before God muſt have <hi>clean Hands, and a pure Heart.</hi> He that <hi>hath not lift up his Soul to Vanity, nor ſworn deceitfully,</hi> Pſal. 24.4. <hi>enters into God's</hi> holy <hi>Hill.</hi> As <hi>Kings love Purity of heart, and grace in the lips,</hi> Prov. 22.11. ſo doth God much more. He <hi>is of purer Eyes then to behold Evil,</hi>
                  <pb n="241" facs="tcp:42122:125"/>he <hi>cannot look on Iniquity</hi> with any good liking. Such as be <hi>fooliſh ſhall not ſtand in his ſight; he hateth all workers of Iniquity: he will deſtroy them that ſpeak lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 5.5, 6. No impure-ſpirited man that hath vain Imaginations of God, that fears him not, <hi>nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is God in all his Thoughts,</hi> can ſtand before him. If <hi>Solomon</hi> would not permit any ſuch about him, neither ſurely will God. Rectitude of Heart is the chief Requiſite, when we appear before him. <hi>Bleſſed are the pure in Heart,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, (<hi>Matth.</hi> 5.8.) <hi>for they ſhall ſee God.</hi> As long as a man retains erroneous Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions in the things of God, as long as vain Thoughts, fraudulent Deſigns, unrighteous Projects, evil Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, lodge in his Heart, and bear ſway in his Actions, he cannot walk acceptably with God. As to Walking well bodily, the chief thing is the Locomotive faculty: ſo in Spiritual Walking before God, the main thing is, to be moved by a right Principle, a due Apprehenſion of God as he is Moſt high.</p>
               <p n="2">2. God muſt be ſet before us not onely as <hi>Maximus,</hi> but alſo as <hi>Optimus;</hi> not onely as the Greateſt, but alſo as the Beſt; not onely as one that can puniſh us, but alſo as one that can and will reward us; as Beſt in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and <hi>good to all that ſeek him.</hi> He that ſhall appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend it <hi>in vain to ſerve God,</hi> and that there is <hi>no profit in walking mournfully before the Lord of hoaſts,</hi> that there is no profit <hi>in keeping his Ordinances,</hi> as thoſe mentioned <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.14. will never walk pleaſantly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God. Such a Servant as looks upon God as <hi>a hard Maſter,</hi> that <hi>reaps where he doth not ſow, and gathers where he did not ſtrew,</hi> will ſhun God and his Service as much as may be; hide his Talent in a Napkin, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then imploy it to improvement for his Maſter. He that walks before God muſt walk <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>exactly,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.15. <hi>circumſpectly</hi> and
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:42122:126"/>diligently. As Courtiers that expect Benefits from their Prince, will be carefull to accommodate themſelves to his Humour, diligent to proſecute his Buſineſs to the utmoſt of their skill and power: ſo is it with thoſe that walk before God, they expect Preferment from him, and therefore are ſtudious to anſwer his Expectation. And when they find God's <hi>Favour</hi> towards them, they prize it as their <hi>Life,</hi> Pſal. 30.5. yea better then Life it ſelf. As the Prince's Favour refreſheth a Servant that attends on him; is <hi>as the Dew upon the tender Herbs,</hi> which makes them ſpring up freſh, and give a ſweet Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour: ſo the Favour of God makes his Servants walk diligently before him, with all readineſs and alacrity doing his Will. So ſaith <hi>David,</hi> Pſalm 26.3. <hi>Thy Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving-kindneſs is before mine eyes; and I have walked in thy Truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And indeed this is the chief Encouragement to a man that walks before God, that he does all for a Prince that is not onely <hi>Deliciae generis humani,</hi> the Love and Delight of mankind, (as <hi>Titus Veſpaſian</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperour was ſtyled;) but that he ſerves a God who is <hi>Love</hi> it ſelf, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.16. in whom there is not onely a River, but an Ocean of Love; not a Pond, but a Fountain of Love. All his ways are Love to his Holy ones. He <hi>loved them with an everlaſting Love,</hi> and <hi>with Loving-kindneſs hath drawn them</hi> to him.</p>
               <p>This was it that made <hi>David</hi> to aim at <hi>walking before God,</hi> becauſe he had found God's Love to him, in <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering his Soul from Death, and his Feet from falling.</hi> Thus God encouraged <hi>Abraham</hi> to walk before him, becauſe he had aſſured him that he was his <hi>Shield and exceeding great Reward,</hi> Gen. 15.1. <hi>It is good for me to draw nigh unto God,</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.28.</p>
               <p>But above all the Manifeſtations of God's Love, that which is the grand Motive to encourage our walking
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:42122:126"/>before God, is, that there is now <hi>a new and living Way</hi> whereby we may <hi>draw nigh</hi> to God, even <hi>through the Veil of</hi> his Son's <hi>Fleſh.</hi> That now the Enmity betwixt us and God, cauſed by <hi>Adam</hi>'s Sin, and Satan's project to alienate Men from God, is taken away. That now there is <hi>on Earth Peace, and Good will towards men.</hi> That now the Son of God is made <hi>the Way, the Truth, and the Life,</hi> whereby we may <hi>come to the Father.</hi> That now we are aſſured, that, however it be that we travel through a Wilderneſs, through a dry and barren Land, where we meet with fiery Serpents and many Wants; yet we have Manna from Heaven to feed on, and we <hi>drink of the Rock, which Rock is Chriſt;</hi> Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Meat, and Spiritual Drink. That <hi>as the Serpent was lifted up</hi> upon the Pole, <hi>ſo the Son of man was lifted up; that whoſoever believeth on him ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting life.</hi> That now we have <hi>the Cloud by day</hi> to ſhade and guide us, and <hi>the Pillar of fire by night</hi> to direct us: we have not the Shadows of the Law, but the clear Light of the Goſpel, to inlighten us with the Light of Heaven. That we have the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit from on high given us, to be a Spirit of Inlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; a Spirit of Regeneration, to beget us again; a Spirit of Life, to quicken us, and make us new Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in <hi>Chriſt;</hi> a Spirit to comfort and refreſh us; a Spirit to intercede for us. And that (which is the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhot of all) there is <hi>a Reſt which remains for the people of God;</hi> not in an earthly <hi>Canaan,</hi> but in the Heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> where we ſhall reſt in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Boſom, in the preſence of the Holy Angels and glorified Saints; in the Arms of our Husband, who hath eſpouſed us to himſelf by the greateſt demonſtration of Love, having <hi>purified us to himſelf</hi> by his Bloud, and <hi>joyned us to himſelf</hi> by his own Spirit. That we ſhall <hi>behold the Face of our Father which is in Heaven,</hi> in whom is all
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:42122:127"/>Beauty, all Worth, and all Love: <hi>everlaſting Joy ſhall be upon our heads, and Sorrow and Miſery ſhall fly away:</hi> we ſhall be <hi>Kings and Prieſts unto God</hi> our Father, and that for ever. So that it will be abundant Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence to us, that we have <hi>walked before God in the light of the living,</hi> if, although it be <hi>through many Tribulations,</hi> yet we at laſt <hi>enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now to the end we may walk before God,</p>
               <p n="1">1. It will be neceſſary, that we inquire into and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Ways and Places wherein God walks, and where he delights to meet with us. The Church in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 64.5. thus ſpeaks to God, <hi>Thou meeteſt him that rejoyceth and worketh Righteouſneſs, thoſe that remember thee in thy Ways.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are indeed <hi>Ways</hi> of God that are <hi>unſearchable, and</hi> Paths <hi>paſt finding out.</hi> The ways of God's Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Reprobation are <hi>ſecret things, belonging to the Lord our God,</hi> and cannot be found out by us, but onely <hi>à poſteriori,</hi> by obſerving how he works in our own Hearts; and thus far onely we are to obſerve them, ſo as to <hi>give all diligence to make our Calling and Election ſure;</hi> that by <hi>doing ſuch things</hi> as may improve the Work of God's Spirit in our Hearts, we <hi>may never fall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Works of God's Providence in the World, and his Works of Creation, we are to inquire into, that we may admire and magnifie him that maketh all. But his Ways of Judgment we are to obſerve, and his Ways of Precept and Promiſe. We are to take notice of his Corrections, when we go aſtray; of his Mercy and Truth, when we walk uprightly: how he meets us with a Rod in his hand, when we wander out of his Paths; with Embraces, with refreſhing Proviſion, when we walk uprightly before him. This was <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>'s
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:42122:127"/>practice, (as he tells us <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.21, 22, 23.) <hi>I have kept,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the Ways of the Lord, and have not wickedly departed from my God. For all his Judgments were before me, and I did not put away his Statutes from me. I was alſo upright before him, and kept my ſelf from mine Iniquity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. As we are to obſerve God's Ways, ſo we are to <hi>prepare</hi> our own <hi>Ways before him:</hi> (as it is ſaid of <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tham,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 27.6.) As he that is to walk with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, muſt provide all things in readineſs, that he may keep him company: ſo muſt he that would walk with God; he muſt <hi>awake, and ſtand up from the dead;</hi> (as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.14.) <hi>awake to Righteouſneſs,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.34. He is not fit to walk with another, that is drowzy and loves to ſlumber: ſo the perſon that will walk before God muſt be wakefull, liſtning to God's Call, ready when he ſhall ſend for him and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire his attendance; he muſt be attentive to all the Motions of his Spirit; be prepared to go with God whitherſoever he will have him. Thus it was with <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> Heb. 11.8. <hi>By Faith, when he was called to go out into a place which he ſhould after receive for an Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance, he obeyed, and went out, not knowing whither he went.</hi> He that will walk before God, muſt not ſit down in that place and ſtate in which he is, and ſay with the Rich man, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.19. <hi>Soul, thou haſt much goods laid up for many years; take thine eaſe, eat, drink, and be merry;</hi> but muſt count himſelf, as <hi>Abraham</hi> did, <hi>a Pilgrim and Sojourner upon Earth:</hi> he muſt not take this Earth to be his reſting-place, but go after <hi>Chriſt, bearing his reproach:</hi> he muſt learn to <hi>deny him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and take up his Croſs, and</hi> ſo <hi>follow him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A Heart that thinks of nothing but how he may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the Good things of this Life, that is ſo minded as <hi>Peter</hi> was in the Mount, that thinks <hi>it is good to be here,</hi>
                  <pb n="246" facs="tcp:42122:128"/>and cries, <hi>Let us build us Tabernacles</hi> below, is not fit to walk with God. He that will walk with God muſt follow him fully: (as it is ſaid of <hi>Caleb,</hi> Num. 14.24. that <hi>he had another Spirit</hi> then the reſt of the Spies, <hi>and followed God fully.</hi>) What way God will have us to take, that we muſt take: where he will have us to be, there we muſt be contented to be: what eſtate his Providence ſhall allot to us, that we muſt embrace: what he will have us to doe, we muſt be willing to doe. We muſt not imagine that we are to walk before God as our Equall, our Fellow, but as our Lord and Maſter; and accordingly muſt be attentive to what he ſaith to us, and be ready to ſubmit to his Pleaſure.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To right Walking before God, it is neceſſary that we ſhould get the Staff of Faith in our hand. It was that which enabled <hi>Abraham</hi> to walk with God, and <hi>Noah,</hi> and <hi>Enoch,</hi> and all the Saints. He that will walk before God, <hi>muſt</hi> not onely <hi>believe that God is,</hi> but alſo that <hi>he is</hi> near unto, and <hi>a Rewarder of them that diligently ſeek him,</hi> Heb. 11.6. He muſt apprehend God with him, while his Heart is towards God. For indeed, nothing will animate us to walk with God, but the aſſurance we have that God will be <hi>with us, while we be with him;</hi> that <hi>if we ſeek him, he will be found of us; if we forſake him, he will forſake us:</hi> as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet told <hi>Aſa,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15.2. As many as mean to walk with God muſt hold faſt this Staff of Faith, to ſtay themſelves in Precipices and ſlippery places, to remove what would caſt them down, to ſupport them when they grow feeble and faint, to clear themſelves of all Incumbrances that may clog them in their going, to beat down all Aſſaults; in a word, to ſtay their Minds ſo, as that by no Inveiglements or Difficulties they may be put out of their way.</p>
               <p n="4">4. He that will walk before the Lord muſt have
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:42122:128"/>low thoughts of himſelf; as <hi>Abraham,</hi> Gen. 18.27. <hi>I have begun to ſpeak unto my Lord, who am but Duſt and Aſhes. He hath ſhewed thee, O man, what is good: and what doth the Lord require of thee, but to doe juſtly, and to love Mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?</hi> Mic. 6.8. It is an humble Heart onely that is fit for God's Company. As he is not fit to wait on a Prince, that is of a ſawcy and malapert Diſpoſition, that thinks as well of himſelf as of his Maſter, that will take upon him to controll him, that is proud and ſtubborn, not flexible and pliable, that will not ſtand bare, obſerve the Ceremonies of his Court, give him his due Titles, nor perform thoſe Rites and Obſervances which belong to his Highneſs: So neither is he fitted to walk with God, who is not of a lowly ſubmiſſive ſpirit; who is not ready to ſtoop to God, to perform his Worſhip, to give him that Honour and Glory which belongs to him; who will glory in himſelf, and not magnifie his Lord.</p>
               <p>To <hi>walk in the Name of the Lord</hi> (Mic. 4.6.) is to worſhip him: and that is done by low Thoughts of our ſelves, and high Thoughts of God. He that walks wiſely, will chuſe low ground to walk on: And he that places himſelf <hi>in Imo ſuo,</hi> in his low Condition, is fitteſt to exalt God <hi>in ipſius Summitatem,</hi> into his Height. <hi>Though the Lord be high, yet he hath reſpect unto the lowly: but he beholdeth the proud afar off,</hi> Pſal. 138.6. he will not have him in his company.</p>
               <p n="5">5. He that walks before God muſt be of a pleaſing Diſpoſition: as the Apoſtle ſpeaks elegantly, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.10. when he prays for the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> that they <hi>may walk worthy of the Lord, unto all pleaſing.</hi> Indeed I told you before, walking with God is pleaſing God: this is the main thing requiſite to our Converſe with God, that we have a care to avoid what is offenſive to him; as <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi> had, when he ſaid, <hi>How ſhall I doe this great Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ſin againſt God?</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="248" facs="tcp:42122:129"/>
               <p>He that will pleaſe God muſt imitate God. We muſt <hi>be Followers of God, as dear Children; and walk in love, as he loved us,</hi> Eph. 5.1, 2. He that will walk with God muſt not be of a quarrelling, wrangling, but a peaceable Diſpoſition. God will not brook him to be with him that perſecutes his Fellow-ſervants, that moleſts his Children, that is not loving and kind to them that honour him. No man can walk with God, that loves not them that are <hi>born of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. He that walks before God muſt affect the Life of God, that is, an heavenly, holy Converſation: he muſt not be <hi>eſtranged from the Life that is in God, through the ignorance that is in him,</hi> and <hi>the hardneſs of his Heart; as</hi> thoſe <hi>Gentiles</hi> that did <hi>walk in the Vanity of their Mind, having their <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding darkened, Eph.</hi> 4.17, 18. He muſt be <hi>as an obedient Child, not faſhioning himſelf according to the former Luſts, in his Ignorance: but as he which hath called him is holy, ſo muſt he be holy in all manner of Converſation; becauſe it is written, Be ye holy, as I am holy,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.14, 15, 16. He muſt walk with Wiſedom in the ſight of the Lord; not as a rude Clown, but as a Courtier of Heaven. <hi>If we ſay that we have Fellowſhip with God, and walk in Darkneſs, we lie, and doe not the Truth: But if we walk in the Light, as he is in the Light, we have fellowſhip one with another,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.6, 7. <hi>Our Converſation</hi> muſt be <hi>in Heaven;</hi> we muſt <hi>ſeek the things that are above, the Kingdom of God and his Righteouſneſs;</hi> we muſt ſpeak the Language of Heaven, expect all our Good from Heaven, follow the Imployment of Heaven, <hi>doe the Will of our Father which is in Heaven.</hi> We muſt ſanctifie and extoll his Name, as the Angels doe, if we expect to be like them hereafter: we muſt ſo doe here, <hi>in the light of the living,</hi> as they doe in Heaven, in the Preſence of God.</p>

               <p>In the firſt <hi>Pſalm</hi> (verſ. 2.) it is ſaid of <hi>David</hi>'s Bleſſed man, that <hi>his Delight is in the Law of the Lord, and in his Law doth he meditate day and night:</hi> by which the Conſtancy of his Meditation is expreſſed. Which is not ſo to be underſtood, as if no other Act were to be done but that; that there was to be no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termiſſion of actuall Reading or Thinking on the words or matter of God's Law: for then all minding and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending other Buſineſs and other Duties, whether Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred or Civill, yea the due uſe of Recreation by eating and drinking, ſleep, and other Refections of the body, (which God allows, yea commands,) ſhould be ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. But as we interpret other like Paſſages concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning continual Praying, (againſt the Dotage of <hi>Euchites</hi> or <hi>Meſſalians</hi> of old, who, as the Monkiſh Fraterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties ſince, thought they were to doe nothing but pray; <hi>Shall not God avenge his own Elect, which cry day and night unto him?</hi> Luke 18.7. <hi>Without ceaſing I have remembrance of thee in my Prayers night and day,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.3.) of a conſtant courſe of doing this Duty when o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Duties, Offices and Neceſſities permit: So in this Meditating of <hi>David</hi> in God's Law, we are to conceive he reſolves ſo to doe it, as not to omit it out of Slothfulneſs, or ſinfull Avocation; not out of averſeneſs of Heart to deſiſt from it: but as often and as much as Opportunity, Divine Providence, and the Uſe of it, did permit and require, he would be occupied therein.</p>
               <p>Concerning which profitable Exerciſe of Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, many Directions might be given in reſpect of the Acts, Degree, Manner, End and Uſe thereof.</p>
               <p>As God appointed the King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when he <hi>ſate on the Throne of his Kingdome,</hi> that <hi>he ſhould write him a Copy of God's Law in a Book, out of that which was before the Prieſts, the Levites, and</hi> that <hi>it ſhould be with him, and</hi> that <hi>he ſhould reade therein all the days of his life;
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:42122:132"/>that he might learn to fear the Lord his God, to keep all the words of the Law and the Statutes to doe them,</hi> Deut. 17.18, 19. So he injoyned the reſt of the People, that <hi>the words which he commanded ſhould be in the Heart of</hi> the whole People of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> and that <hi>they ſhould teach them diligently unto their Children, and ſhould talk of them when they ſate in their houſes, and when they walked by the way, and when they lay down, and when they roſe up,</hi> Deut. 6.6, 7. Which brings us to the</p>

               <head>II. OBSERVATION.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>That God's Precepts are to be the matter of a Godly man's Talk.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yea, God commands that <hi>they ſhould bind them for a Sign upon their Hand, and</hi> that <hi>they ſhould be as Front<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets between their Eyes, and</hi> that <hi>they ſhould write them upon the Poſts of their houſes, and on their Gates,</hi> Deut. 6.8, 9.</p>
               <p>And that this Precept was not confined to the Five Books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> but that it exended to the reſt of the Holy Scriptures, that which is ſaid of <hi>Timothy,</hi> (2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15. that <hi>from a child he had known the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which were able to make him wiſe unto Salvation</hi>) doth evince. It is alſo manifeſt, that the people of the <hi>Jews</hi> (as they do to this day) did conceive themſelves bound by God, old and young, of all Sexes and Ranks, to exerciſe themſelves in reading and meditating on the Holy Scriptures, which God vouchſafed to them in all the Books that were by any of the Prophets delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to them. To which accords that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.4. <hi>Whatſoever things were written aforetime, were written for our learning, that we through Patience and Comfort of the Scriptures might have hope.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is then evident, that it was God's Inſtitution and
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:42122:132"/>Deſign, in vouchſafing to communicate to the ſons of men the great Treaſure of his Oracles, that they ſhould buſy their Minds and Members about them.</p>
               <p>Nor is this ſufficient, that they have them in their Houſes: or that the Grandees of the Earth for Parts and Learning, the Clergy, Prieſts, and Religious Votaries, do reade or ſtudy them; while the Laiety, or ſimpler ſort, do onely by an implicit Faith rely on their Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers or Rabbins; as heretofore the Judaicall <hi>Phariſees,</hi> and at this day their Succeſſours, the Popiſh Clergy, craftily and deceitfully inſinuate into peoples minds. But as God hath promiſed to <hi>write his Laws in their hearts, and put them in their minds;</hi> that <hi>they ſhall all know him, from the leaſt to the greateſt:</hi> ſo it is the Duty and Property of all that expect Mercy and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour from God, to imploy their own Eyes to reade, and their own Ears to hear, what God hath vouchſafed to impart of his Mind, in them, to the ſons of men. And not onely ſo, but alſo to <hi>ſearch into the</hi> Sacred <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> as our Lord requires, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.39. to <hi>ſeek</hi> after the Wiſedom therein <hi>as for Silver, and ſearch for it as for hidden Treaſure,</hi> Prov. 2.4. and when any Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine is taught as from God, to doe as it is ſaid of the <hi>Beroeans,</hi> Act. 17.11. who <hi>ſearched the Scriptures daily, whether the things</hi> S. <hi>Paul</hi> preached <hi>were ſo or no;</hi> and withall, <hi>ſpeaking the truth in love,</hi> to <hi>edify one another</hi> by communicating what they have found and learned.</p>
               <p>And indeed the Law of Gratitude binds us to medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate on God's Precepts, it being one of the greateſt Favours from God to Men, that he is pleaſed to reveal his Will to them. Among the many Mercies for which the Pſalmiſt extolls God's Goodneſs, after the Comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moration of his Providence in his ordering Peace and Plenty, he concludes thus, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147.19, 20. <hi>He ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his Word unto Jacob, his Statutes and his Judgments
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:42122:133"/>unto Iſrael. He hath not dealt ſo with any Nation; and as for his Judgments they have not known them. Praiſe ye the Lord.</hi> Which plainly intimates this to have been the top or chief of his Goodneſs to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> not that he ſeated them in <hi>a Land flowing with Milk and Honey, which was the glory of other Lands,</hi> Ezek. 20.6. but that he revealed his Counſells to them, whereby he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced them above all the people of the Earth; as <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> tells them, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.8. <hi>What Nation is there ſo great, that hath Statutes and Judgments ſo righteous, as all this Law which I ſet before you this day?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It would therefore be an high Provocation of God to Anger, ſo far to neglect the great Favour he hath ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in giving us ſuch Holy Precepts and beneficial Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of his Counſell, as not to make them our Study, not to conſider the Uſefulneſs of them, not to obſerve our Concernments in them, not to ſet forth to his Praiſe his gracious dealing in his notification of them to us.</p>
               <p>But beſides, as it is an extreme Neglect of God not to meditate on his Precepts: ſo it is a moſt injurious Neglect of our ſelves and our own Good, to take our ſelves off from the Contemplation of them. For there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by men deprive themſelves of that means, which might make them wiſer then thoſe who neglect them, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy their minds on any enquiry after Wiſedom with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them. Which it were eaſy to demonſtrate, by comparing the Wiſedom that may be got by them, with the Wiſedom of the moſt renowned Philoſophers, and the moſt profound Rabbins among the <hi>Jews,</hi> or acuteſt Schoolmen among the Chriſtians, who have ſought the knowledge of Morality or Religion from Inventions and Traditions of men, from their own Reaſonings or deviſed Rules, without the excellent Directions of the Holy Scritures. Holy <hi>David</hi> profeſſeth his own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:42122:133"/>
                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.97, 98, 99, 100. <hi>O how love I thy Law! it is my Meditation all the day. Thou through thy Commandments haſt made me wiſer then mine Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: for they are ever with me. I have more under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding then all my Teachers: for thy Teſtimonies are my Meditation. I underſtand more then the Ancients, becauſe I keep thy Precepts.</hi> And S. <hi>Paul</hi> tells <hi>Timothy,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15. that <hi>the Holy Scriptures were able to make him wiſe unto Salvation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The greateſt Wiſedom is that which guides a man to the greateſt Happineſs; and that is, when he avoids the greateſt Evill, and attains the enjoyment of the beſt Good. No Evil is greater then God's Wrath; no Good better then God's Favour. Now to the eſcaping the former, and obtaining the latter, the Meditation on God's Precepts conduceth moſt effectually. For thereby we avoid Sin againſt God, which incites him to Anger; and thereby we learn how to pleaſe him, which procures his Favour. And therefore it is moſt evident to be the wiſeſt courſe we can take, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we can ſhew moſt Love to our ſelves, to Reade, to Hear, to Study and lay to heart God's Word. And herein likewiſe we ſhew the greateſt Charity to others, by ſeriouſly endeavouring to make them intelligent therein: it tending moſt to their Good, if with Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation there concurre alſo a Reſpect to God's Ways. Which leads us to the other part of this Verſe, and the Concluſions thence deduced.</p>

               <p>The word which is rendred, <hi>I will have reſpect,</hi> or,
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:42122:134"/>
                  <hi>I will look,</hi> imports the fixing and intentiveneſs of the Eye upon God's Ways; ſuch as is in a Traveller when he walks, or a Sailour when he ſails in the Deep, whom it concerns that they have their eyes waking, and their minds obſervant, the one of the Path he treads in, the other of the Chanel he ſteers his Ship in: leſt the firſt either miſs his way, or ſtumble and fall; or the ſecond run aground on Quick-ſands, or ſplit upon Rocks and Shelves, and ſo miſcarry. <hi>The Commandment,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon,</hi> (Prov. 6.23.) <hi>is a Lamp, and the Law is Light; and Reproofs of Inſtruction are the way of life.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as the Eye makes uſe of the Lamp and Light, for its Direction: ſo doth the Soul of a Godly man obſerve the Way of God's Precepts, for his Rule; and the Ways of God's Acting, to encourage him in his Courſe, and to deterre him from wandering therefrom.</p>
               <p>Nor are the Ways of God's Providence, either to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards our ſelves or others, to be let paſs without heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Obſervation. For thereby we are accommodated with uſefull Arguments to give God the Glory of his Truth, Juſtice, Goodneſs, and Power. We have Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments fitted either to deterre us from Sinning againſt him, who is <hi>a conſuming Fire;</hi> or to encourage us to ſerve him with holy Reverence and godly Fear; or to ſtrengthen our Faith in a firm Dependence on him, and a Reliance on the Lord in our greateſt Difficulties.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Phineas</hi> argues, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 22.17, 20. <hi>Is the Iniquity of Peor too little for us, from which we are not cleanſed to this day? Did not Achan the ſon of Zerah commit a Treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs in the accurſed thing, and Wrath fell on all the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of Iſrael? and that man periſhed not alone in his Iniquity.</hi> That he might by this Argument deterre the <hi>Trans-Jordan Iſraelites</hi> from a Schiſmaticall departure from the God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and a Communion in Worſhip with the other Tribes on this ſide <hi>Jordan.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="259" facs="tcp:42122:134"/>
               <p>Thus <hi>David,</hi> in the great Trial of his Faith and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted Fortitude which he ſhewed in his heroick En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter with the Giant of <hi>Gath,</hi> recollects his own Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of Divine Aſſiſtence formerly, and fortifies himſelf againſt the fear of that Monſter by aſſurance of the like now. He alleges God's former Providences as the reaſon of his gallant Reſolution to encounter <hi>Goliah</hi> without any heſitancy now; telling <hi>Saul,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17.36. <hi>Thy Servant ſlew both the Lion and the Bear: and this uncircumciſed Philiſtine ſhall be as one of them, ſeeing he hath defied the Armies of the living God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As God hath given us his Word, that thereby we may underſtand his Will: ſo doth he exerciſe his Judgments, that we may diſcern his Excellency. As the Word of God, his Precepts and Promiſes are to be remembred, that we may believe and obey; and therefore it is the Character of a Righteous perſon, that <hi>the Law of his God is in his Heart,</hi> and <hi>none of his Steps</hi> therefore <hi>ſhall ſlide:</hi> (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.31.) ſo it is ſaid, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 111.2, 3, 4. <hi>The Works of the Lord are great, ſought out of all them that have pleaſure therein.</hi> God having made <hi>his Work honourable and glorious,</hi> that <hi>his wonderfull Works might be remembred.</hi> And therefore a <hi>Woe</hi> is denounced by the Prophet, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5.11, 12. againſt thoſe <hi>Epicurean</hi> Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſualiſts that ſpent their time in voluptuous Drinking, and pleaſant Muſick; but <hi>regarded not the Work of the Lord, neither conſidered the Operation of his hands:</hi> To which anſwers that true Cenſure of the Prophet <hi>Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah,</hi> (5.4.) <hi>Surely theſe are poor, they are fooliſh; for they know not the Way of the Lord, nor the Judgment of their God.</hi> In having reſpect to both kinds of his Ways we glorify him: in neglecting either, we vilify him, and live as it were <hi>without God in the World.</hi>

               <p>Hereby we may diſcern whether we have the ſame Spirit with <hi>David</hi> and other Holy perſons in their ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, who have always had their Eyes fixed on God in their Pilgrimage on earth; and their Minds intent on what God ſaith and doeth, as the principall Object whereon to imploy their Meditations and Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citations.</p>
               <p>When we reade of <hi>Enoch, Noah, Abraham,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Holy perſons, that they <hi>walked with God,</hi> we may thereby collect that they moved in a higher Sphere then this lower World: and though their Bodies were car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried up and down on the Superficies of the Earth; yet their Hearts and Spirits were with God, him they ſet before them, and kept cloſe to him. And ſo <hi>David</hi> profeſſeth of himſelf, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.21, 22, 23. <hi>I have kept the ways of the Lord, and have not wickedly departed from my God: For all his Judgments were before me, and I did not put away his Statutes from me. I was alſo up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right before him, and I kept my ſelf from mine Iniquity.</hi> And <hi>S.

               </p>
               <p>Surely they that ſeriouſly mind being with God here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, muſt make it their buſineſs to get acquaintance with him here: they that look for their Portion in Heaven, muſt have their Converſation in Heaven while they are upon Earth.</p>
               <p>As it is the deſcription of a wicked man, that <hi>God is not in all his Thoughts,</hi> that <hi>God's Judgments are far a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove out of his ſight,</hi> that he <hi>caſts God's Word behind his back,</hi> that he <hi>hides his face from God:</hi> So on the other ſide, nothing is a more reall demonſtration of a Holy perſon then this, that he meditates on God's Precepts, and hath reſpect unto his Ways.</p>

               <p>Oh that it might be verified of each of you, that you have the ſame Mind that <hi>David</hi> had.

Survey the Motions of your Mind, of your Tongues, of your Eyes; you will, I fear, find too little of <hi>David</hi>'s Imployment uſed by you. Do not your Inquiries, your Conſcience, your Practice, ſhew how little your Thoughts are upon God, his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, his Counſells, Commands, or Works?</p>

Are not theſe things, or ſuch like, all that is ſought after or minded, when we are ſtill asking after News at Court, in City, or Country? when we liſten ſo greedily after what Intelligence the moſt inquiſitive men can give us of theſe things?</p>
               <p>But ſeldome do you apply your ſelves to know how to rectify your Conſciences, by right Information con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning God's Will; little notice do you take of God's ſtirring up your Hearts to pray, his anſwering your Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, or rewarding your Obedience, or puniſhing your Tranſgreſſions. How few Memorialls are kept either of publick Plagues or common Deliverances? How ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous are we to pleaſe Men? how careleſs to pleaſe God? how intent and diligent to promote our Earthly, how negligent and ſlack to farther Heavenly-Deſigns?</p>

            <p>It is true, the Temple was not built by <hi>David,</hi> but by <hi>Solomon</hi> his Son: yet <hi>David</hi> had <hi>prepared a place for the Ark of God in his City,</hi> and <hi>pitched for it a Tent,</hi> where there were <hi>offered Burnt-offerings and Peace-offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings before the Lord,</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15.1. and 16.1. and <hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the Levites were appointed to miniſter before the Ark of the Lord, and to record, and to thank and praiſe the Lord God of Iſrael,</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16.4.

My Soul hath long dwelt with him that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth Peace:</hi> Yet, (as that which cut him moſt to the Heart in his Exile was his Abſence from the Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, and thoſe bitter Sarcaſms of his Enemies, when they ſaid to him inſultingly, <hi>Where is now thy God?</hi> ſo now) he moſt rejoyceth that he is reſtored to the Houſe of God; that now God's Worſhip was begun to be ſolemnized, and he with the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented it with Gladneſs. This was the conſtant frame of <hi>David</hi>'s Spirit; as may appear, in that he laid aſide his Robes of Royal Majeſty, and (putting on a linen Ephod in company of the Prieſts) danced before the Ark: and when he was derided by <hi>Michal</hi> his Wife, as if it ſhewed Lightneſs in him; he juſtified himſelf as being guilty of no Indecency, ſince <hi>it was before the Lord, who had choſen him before her Father, and before all his Houſe, to appoint him Ruler over the people of the Lord, over Iſrael.</hi> He knew his Exaltation was from God, his Favour was better to him then his Kingdom; therefore in it he rejoyced more then in his Regality, and thought he could not rejoyce enough in the Lord, nor ſufficiently debaſe himſelf before him: and this
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:42122:137"/>made him reſolutely tell his Wife, that he would play before the Lord, and <hi>be more vile then thus, and baſe in his own ſight;</hi> being aſſured that this was the ready way to his Honour. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6.21, 22. And not content with this demonſtration of his glorying in God, in the next Chapter, verſ. 2. he complains of it as a reaſon of his Diſcontent, that <hi>he dwelt in a houſe of Cedar,</hi> when <hi>the Ark of God dwelt within Curtains.</hi> So true was it of him which he profeſſeth <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69.9. <hi>The Zeal of thine Houſe hath eaten me up; and the Reproaches of them that reproached thee are fallen upon me.</hi> Which was more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly and amply fulfilled in our Lord <hi>Chriſt,</hi> to whoſe Purging of the Temple from the profane and unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Abuſes thereof the firſt part is applied <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.17. and the ſecond to his Sufferings for his Faithfulneſs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Spiritual Houſe of God, by teſtifying the Truth of God notwithſtanding <hi>the Contradiction of Sinners,</hi> Rom. 15.3.</p>
            <p>That this is a Duty common to all, to prefer the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of God, and the Service of his Houſe, before any Grandeur or Concernment of our own, is abundantly manifeſt from the Precedency of the Firſt Table of the Law before the Second; the Precept of Loving God, before the Command of Loving our Neighbour: from our petitioning (according to the Lord's Prayer) for the Hallowing God's Name, the Coming of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, the Doing his Will, before the ſupplying of our Bread, the Remiſſion of our Sins, or our Deliverance from the Evil one's Temptations: from the Excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons God takes againſt them that built themſelves <hi>cieled houſes,</hi> when <hi>God's Houſe lay waſte;</hi> them that <hi>had in their flock a male, and vowed to the Lord a corrupt thing:</hi> from his puniſhing ſuch Slighting of him, and aſſerting his Regal Majeſty, to convince men of the tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Regard that is due to him above all Potentates:
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:42122:138"/>from the Proteſtations and Practice of Saints and Holy perſons, preferring the well-being of God's Houſe and Service before their chief Mirth; peremptorily refuſing Delights, neglecting any other Glory or otherwiſe deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Advantage, when God's Houſe or Honour is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired; Mourning for it more then for their own Loſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; and reckoning them for their beſt-deſerving Friends that promote the Service of God, and them for their greateſt Enemies that hinder it. The Reaſons of which are,</p>
            <p n="1">1. On God's part, His ſuperlative Excellency, in compariſon of whom all the Glory, Beauty, Goodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Power, Wiſedom, or what-ever elſe is magnified in Creatures, is but a Shadow, yea Vanity, or a mere Nothing. All <hi>the Nations</hi> of the Earth, in reſpect of him, <hi>are as a drop of a Bucket, counted as the ſmall duſt of the balance, as Nothing,</hi> Iſa. 40.15, 17. And therefore to prefer our own Honour, the Honour of any of the Grandees of the world, or the glorious Spirits of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, before the Worſhip, the <hi>Regalia</hi> or Royalties of the Great God, who is <hi>King of Kings, and Lord of Lords,</hi> is to prefer a Torch-light before the Sun-light; to eſteem a Candle more then the glorious Lights of Heaven. As there is in God more Glory then in all the Creatures; ſo his Name, his Service ſhould be magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied and adhered unto above and againſt all the Services and Names that ſtand in oppoſition to or competition with his.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Nor is this Prelation leſs due on our part, becauſe of our Obligation of Gratitude to him: Juſtice exacts it from us. It is <hi>Debitum morale,</hi> and <hi>naturale,</hi> that we ſhould honour our Father that begat us, our Preachers that inſtruct us, our Princes that protect us, our Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factours that help us. All theſe is God to us in a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perlative manner. He is <hi>the Father that begat us, the
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:42122:138"/>Rock that formed us:</hi> we are <hi>the Work of his Hands, and the Sheep of his Paſture.</hi> He is <hi>our Shepherd,</hi> therefore <hi>we lack nothing; on him we depend from our mother's womb.</hi> It is he that <hi>teacheth us</hi> Wiſedom <hi>more then the beaſts of the Earth.</hi> He is <hi>a Sun and a Shield</hi> to us: what-ever good we receive from any, it is firſt derived from him. He is <hi>the Fountain of living waters:</hi> all Creatures are but <hi>broken Ciſterns, that can hold no water.</hi> And therefore undoubtedly he ſhould be preferr'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all, and by all. Which that it may be done, we ſhould have the like Affection as <hi>David</hi> had; and that is the next thing obſervable in this Text.</p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>David</hi>'s Joy at the People's Forwardneſs to joyn in God's Worſhip.</p>
            <p>As <hi>David</hi> preferred God's Service before his own Dignity, ſo he rejoyced in the Conjunction of others with him therein. This was it which gladded his Heart, that not onely himſelf and his own Houſe were ready to goe up to the Houſe of the Lord, but all the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> likewiſe were forward to joyn with him in God's Service. When <hi>the People offered willingly to the Lord</hi> for the building of the Temple, it is ſaid, <hi>David the King alſo rejoyced with great Joy,</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.9. How often in the Pſalms doth he invite all people to praiſe God? <hi>Praiſe him all ye Nations,</hi> Pſal. 117.1. is a Prophecy, containing his Prayer for the Converſion of the Gentiles, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.11. Our Saviour teacheth us to pray, not onely that we our ſelves who pray, but all others may <hi>hallow God's Name.</hi> When the <hi>Phariſees</hi> would have had the Children and Multitude, that cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Hoſanna</hi> with his Diſciples, rebuked; our Saviour not onely juſtifies them, but alſo animates them to it, telling the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> that <hi>if thoſe ſhould hold their peace, the Stones would cry our,</hi> Luke 19.40. Malignant ſpirits, that ſeek the Praiſe of men, their own Power and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt,
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:42122:139"/>envy the forwardneſs of people to joyn in the true Worſhip of God, and the Duties of Godlineſs. But to a holy and humble Heart it is a joyous thing. As <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid once to <hi>Joſhua, Envieſt thou for my ſake? I would that all the Lord's people were Prophets, and that God would put his Holy Spirit upon them,</hi> Num. 11.29. Hereto every upright heart is moved, both by the Love he bears to Men, and the Love he hath to God who is honoured.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Love to others makes him that loves them not ſeek his own Good onely, but their Good alſo joyntly with his own. Now there cannot be a greater Good to any perſon, then when his Heart and Ways are ſet to glorifie God. The beſt turn we can doe a man is, to bring him into Acquaintance with God, ſo as that his <hi>Fellowſhip be with the Father, and with his Son Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> And therefore if we love men indeed, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but rejoyce with them when they addreſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to ſeek God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Love alſo to God will cauſe this Rejoycing at the Aſſociating of others with us in his Service. The <hi>Corinthians</hi> Bounty to the Saints is commended from hence, that it <hi>is abundant by many Thanksgivings unto God, whiles by the experiment of ſuch miniſtration they glorifie God,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.12, 13. We pray that all may ſanctifie God's Name: what we pray for ſincerely, we deſire affectionately: and what we deſire affectionate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to obtain, we rejoyce in it heartily when it is acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. No man prays to God rightly, but he who ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly deſires God's Glory by all: the more therefore glorifie him, the more is their Joy increaſed who love God truly; eſpecially when (as here) the Service is voluntary, ready, with alacrity; when they ſay, (as it is in my Text) <hi>Let us goe into the Houſe of the Lord.</hi> Which leads me to ſome farther Obſervations.</p>
            <pb n="269" facs="tcp:42122:139"/>
            <p n="3">III. The People's Willingneſs and Forwardneſs: They invite each other to goe into the Houſe of the Lord. Not to the houſe of Mirth and Jovialty; not to the houſe of <hi>Bacchus</hi> or <hi>Baal;</hi> not to the Idol-Temple, or other houſe of Iniquity. And therein is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernible the End and Motive of this their Invitation. It was, no doubt, that they might worſhip God; as thoſe did who <hi>went up into the Temple to pray,</hi> as it is ſaid of the <hi>Phariſee</hi> and Publican in the Parable; or, as it is in the fourth verſe of this Pſalm, <hi>to the Teſtimony of Iſrael, to give Thanks unto the Name of the Lord.</hi> Thus it is ſaid, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.10. while the Prieſt burnt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe in the Temple, <hi>the whole multitude of the people were praying without.</hi> And of <hi>Anna,</hi> Luk. 2.37. ſhe <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted not from the Temple, but ſerved God with Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting and Prayers night and day.</hi> And in reſpect of this Practice our Saviour <hi>Matth.</hi> 21.13. allegeth out of <hi>Iſa.</hi> 56.7. that <hi>the Houſe of God was to be the houſe of Prayer,</hi> not of Merchandiſe or other profane uſes. Hereto accords that which is foretold <hi>Iſa.</hi> 2.3. of the New-Teſtament-times, alluſively to the practice of the <hi>Jews, Many people ſhall goe and ſay, Come ye, and let us goe up to the Mountain of the Lord, to the Houſe of the God of Jacob, and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths.</hi> This then is the genuine End of going to <hi>the Houſe of God,</hi> or <hi>the Church of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God, the pillar and ground of Truth,</hi> that we may pray together, and praiſe God with one Heart; that we may learn the Will of God; that we may attend to the Preaching of the Word, to the Reading of the Scriptures, to the Sacraments of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and, in a word, that <hi>we may with one mind and one mouth glorifie God, even the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Which directs us alſo to conſider,</p>
            <pb n="270" facs="tcp:42122:140"/>
            <p n="4">IV. The Motive and Mode of their going up to the Houſe of the Lord.</p>
            <p>The Motive is implied in the determination to whoſe houſe they would goe up, to wit, to the Houſe of <hi>Jehovah,</hi> the true and living God: not to the Houſe of <hi>Dagon, Moloch,</hi> or any of the Gentile Vanities; but to his Houſe who was <hi>their Defence, the Holy one of Iſrael, their King,</hi> Pſal. 89.18. It is Faith in God as the true God, and in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt whom he hath ſent,</hi> which muſt excite us to goe to the Church on Earth, to joyn with it in Holy Services; and to <hi>approach boldly to the Throne of Grace</hi> in the Temple of Heaven, where <hi>Chriſt our High Prieſt appears for us:</hi> it is that muſt quicken our Hearts, that muſt carry our Feet to the Houſe of God and Religious exerciſes.</p>
            <p>Alas! many come to the Church out of Cuſtome, or to avoid the Penalties of the Law, yea perhaps to ſleep there; as if they had no ſenſe of God's Preſence, no ſpiritual Uſe of holy Ordinances, no need of holy In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, no want of God's Favour, or <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion: and therefore they neither exerciſe Faith in Prayer or Praiſing God, nor have any feeling of the Worth of Spiritual Services. They are no better after they have been at Church then they were before; no more humbled for Sin, nor amended in their Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, nor intelligent in the Doctrine of the Goſpel, nor zealous for God's Glory, nor helpfull to edifie one another, then if they had kept at home, or been in profane Company. They are not like theſe in my Text, who here invited each other to <hi>goe to the Houſe of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which implies the Mode or Manner of their going.</p>
            <p>Three things I conceive implied in this Expreſſion; Reverence, Unanimity, Alacrity.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In that they goe to the Houſe of the Lord, it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timates
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:42122:140"/>that they did preſent themſelves there with Dread and Awe of God. They were wont to ſay, as it is <hi>Pſal.</hi> 95.6. <hi>O come let us worſhip and bow down, let us kneel before the Lord our Maker.</hi> Thus it ſhould be with us: And therefore this Pſalm is appointed in our Liturgy to be read in the beginning of Divine Service. Our Reverence ſhould be not barely in reſpect of the preſence of perſons of Eminency, whether Miniſters or People; but more in reſpect of God's Preſence. We ſhould be like affected as <hi>Jacob</hi> was, and ſay as he did, <hi>Gen.</hi> 28.17. <hi>How dreadfull is this Place! this is none other but the Houſe of God, and this is the Gate of Heaven.</hi> All Talking, Gazing, and other irreverent Carriage, (as is too too often among us,) even while we are here a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Holy Duties, ſhews an irreligious and ungodly Spirit, and cannot but be odious to God, and bring his Curſe upon us.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Their Unanimity is intimated in their Invitation of each other, and joynt Aſſociation in going to the Houſe of the Lord. And indeed this is alſo of very great moment in the publick Worſhip of God, that, as it was in the Primitive times, we be <hi>of one Heart and one Soul,</hi> Act. 4.32. that we <hi>continue together with one accord, breaking bread,</hi> and <hi>lift up our voice with one accord, by praiſing God,</hi> Act. 2.46. and 4.24. To think to get Peace with God by our Supplications, when we have unpeaceable Hearts towards others; to have For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs from God, while we forgive not our Brethren; to have God's Love, while we love not one another; is a vain Deluſion. To pray together at Church, and quarrel at home; to ſit in one Seat here, and to fight one with another abroad; to ſay <hi>Amen</hi> to the Prayer for Peace, and yet to ſtudy Strife; is monſtrous Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie. To praiſe God in ſinging Pſalms here, and yet to curſe and revile one another abroad, is horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:42122:141" rendition="simple:additions"/>Impiety. But to brawl, contend for places in the Church, before or immediately after Praying together, ſhews a much more wicked Heart: <hi>For where Envy and Strife is, there is Confuſion, and every evil work,</hi> Jam. 3. verſ. 16.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Therefore the third thing implied here, Alacrity, ſhould attend our going to the Houſe of the Lord. We ſhould <hi>ſerve the Lord with Gladneſs, come before his Preſence with Rejoycing,</hi> as it is <hi>Pſal.</hi> 100.2. which is read in our Liturgie after the Second Leſſon. <hi>God loves</hi> a chearfull Worſhiper, as well as <hi>a chearfull Giver.</hi> As we would have God delight in us, ſo we muſt <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light our ſelves in the Lord,</hi> and readily and freely, out of choice, come to the Houſe of the Lord, and there ſerve him.</p>
            <div type="application">
               <head>APPLICATION.</head>
               <p>And now give me leave both to complain, and to admoniſh you. God hath done for us greater things then he did for <hi>David:</hi> his Goſpel, his Church, his Worſhip is ſettled among us in a more Spiritual and Heavenly manner then it was among the <hi>Jews:</hi> we are not <hi>carried away</hi> as the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who <hi>were led by dumb Idols:</hi> we have not mere <hi>Latin</hi> Service, not the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of a piece of Bread, as the <hi>Papiſts;</hi> nor are we fed with Legendary Tales or mens Traditions: much leſs are we, like the barbarous Heathens, awed by Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, the terrible Apparitions of Devils, Wizzards, and ſuch Imps of Hell, as many of them are; or cheated with the ridiculous Fictions and Deluſions of that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure Impoſtour <hi>Mahomet;</hi> or impoſed on by the Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binical Dotages of <hi>Jews:</hi> And yet we come to God's Service with no better Devotion, nay, perhaps leſs, then theſe do to their falſe Worſhip.</p>
               <pb n="273" facs="tcp:42122:141"/>
               <p>How few prefer God's Service before their own worldly Buſineſs, God's Honour before their own Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit? How many are ſo far from inciting others to goe to God's Houſe, that they are readier to draw them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from it? Yea, many chuſe to keep at home, or to goe to worſe places and company. Many have no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther End in coming to Church, but to keep their wont, to doe as others. Others come either out of a vain Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectation to ſhew their Bravery, or a Curioſity to hear ſome eloquent Preacher, as thoſe did <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.30, 31, 32. with affection to one party, oppoſition to another, yea with a contradicting Spirit. How many come hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther without Faith, or ſenſe of God's Preſence, as if they came to a Court? yea to ſport or play? With what Drowzineſs, Irreverence, Heedleſneſs, do many appear here? How many are weary with the Service, with the Sermon? to whom it is tedious to ſit one hour to hear God's Word, though they can endure to ſit whole Nights and Days at their Paſtimes, or to be imployed in any miſchievous Deſign? How many bring their Bodies hither, and their Minds the while are roving over the world? How many are filled with unclean Luſts, Contentions, revengefull Imaginations and Devices, even while they are in the Church? How many come to carp at the Preacher, or juſtle with their Brethren? How many pray with their Mouths, and curſe with their Hearts?</p>
               <p>Alas! how will ſuch bear <hi>Crucem Domini,</hi> the Lord's Croſs, who are ſo backward to goe <hi>in Domum Domini,</hi> into the Lord's Houſe? How can ſuch expect to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in the Temple of God in Heaven, who defile the Houſe of God on Earth? How weary would they be of the Service there, to whom his Worſhip here is ſo tedious?</p>
               <p>Brethren, let me deal plainly with you; It is an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minous
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:42122:142" rendition="simple:additions"/>Preſage, an ill Sign, that ſuch as now are ſo averſe from the Houſe of God and his Service here, are never likely to enter into the Temple of God in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; it would be a Burthen to them, and they to it.</p>
               <p>Oh then bethink your ſelves of coming hither, as <hi>David</hi> and his People did. Prefer the Honour of God before any Intereſt of your own. Excite one another to goe to God's Houſe, out of Love to one another, out of Love and Gratitude to God. Goe not to any Idol-ſervice, or ungodly Meetings. Come to God's Service with Faith, with Concord and Unanimity, with Chearfulneſs and Reverence. And know, that if you meet with God in his Ordinances, he will meet with you in his Mercies.

            <p>THIS Pſalm is wholly doctrinall, ſomewhat ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificially compoſed after the order of the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi> Alphabet; it is likely, for the more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy learning and eaſie remembring of it. The matter of it is, a Receipt to cure that Lipothymie or Faintneſs of Spirit which is incident to the beſt men, when they ſee the worſt to proſper. Which as it is in appearance rationall, ſo it is highly dangerous, as tending to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermine our Faith in God's Providence, and to divert our Courſe from the <hi>Via Regia,</hi> the high and right Way of holy Obedience to him, to a walking in By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways of our own chuſing.</p>
            <p>To prevent which (after ſome Directions againſt Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience, and Diſtruſt of God) this Doſe is here preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, by one that could ſay <hi>Probatum eſt,</hi> even by Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>David,</hi> the ſweet Pſalmiſt of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who had by his
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:42122:143"/>own Experience found it true, and the moſt ſovereign Medicine and Cordiall in this caſe. He had obſerved, That notwithſtanding the wicked man proſpered a while, and like a Comet blazed much; yet it was but as a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teor, a Blazing-ſtar, that would ſoon vaniſh: But that he who truſts in God, and delights in him, ſhould be as a Fixed Star, which, though it be clouded or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nighted for a time, yet it hath a permanent Light, and ſhall break out of its Obſcurity. That it is therefore beſt for ſuch a one, in the greateſt Luſter of the Wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, and in the moſt diſmall eſtate that befalls himſelf, yet to <hi>delight himſelf in the Lord,</hi> and to aſſure himſelf that <hi>he will give him the Deſire of his Heart.</hi>

                  <hi>That it is beſt to delight our ſelves in God in the moſt elevated eſtate of Evill men, and in our own moſt dejected Condition.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Delight</hi> is an inclining Affection of the Soul, upon the apprehenſion of ſome pleaſing Good that is ſutable to the Mind: and it is conceived in the womb of the Heart; but not reſting there, it manifeſts it ſelf by the motions of the Members, by the ſpeech of the Tongue, glances of the Eyes, hearkning of the Ears, and by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther geſtures of the Members, which diſcover the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency of the Spirit within.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Delighting</hi> then <hi>in the Lord,</hi> is, for a man to have pleaſing Thoughts of God, and thereby ſtrengthening his Heart and Mind againſt all Objections concerning God or himſelf, againſt all Fears and Occurrences which might caſt down his Spirit. Many ſadning Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects do often preſent themſelves even to the moſt Holy men on earth. We find <hi>David</hi> ſometimes complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that God had <hi>caſt him off; I am cut off from before thine eyes:</hi> Holy <hi>Job,</hi> that <hi>God hid his Face from him, and held him for his Enemy.</hi> Such Complaints are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, <hi>Thou haſt caſt us off, and putteſt us to ſhame. Wherefore hideſt thou thy Face? Why ſayeſt thou, O Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob, My way is hid from the Lord, and my Judgment is paſſed over from my God?</hi> Others cry, <hi>Wherefore doth the Way of the Wicked proſper?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moſt fully we find this Argument urged againſt God's Providence, even to the ſtaggering of that Holy Pſalmiſt, in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.2, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> where he relates his Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and his Recovery out of it. For notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:42122:144"/>what his Eyes ſaw, his Ears heard, his fleſhly Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſuggeſted to him, of the Happineſs of Evil men, and the vanity of Godly courſes; yet he upholds him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by delighting in the Lord; and thus expreſſeth himſelf in that Pſalm: Verſ. 1. <hi>Truly God is good to Iſrael, even to ſuch as are of a clean heart;</hi> and after, verſ. 23, 24, 25, 26, 28. <hi>Nevertheleſs I am continually with thee; thou haſt holden me by my right hand. Thou ſhalt guide me with thy Counſell, and afterwards receive me to Glory. Whom have I in Heaven but thee? and there is none upon Earth that I deſire beſides thee. My Fleſh and my Heart faileth; but God is the ſtrength of my Heart, and my portion for ever. It is good for me to draw near to God: I have put my Truſt in the Lord God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Such Apprehenſions as theſe do affect the Spirits of a man, as the breaking out of the Sun doth the Eyes, after it hath been overcaſt with thick Clouds in the day, or concealed by the Darkneſs of the night. Then <hi>the Light is ſweet, and it is a pleaſant thing to behold the Sun.</hi> So it is with the Soul, after ſuch Perplexities and Affrightments and Diſconſolations of Spirit as are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident to the moſt holy Saint, by reaſon of the ſeeming Diſorders and diſmall Occurrences in the world which are obvious to him. When he recollects himſelf, and determines againſt all Arguings <hi>ad oppoſitum,</hi> that <hi>the Lord God is a Sun and a Shield; the Lord will give Grace and Glory; no good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly. O Lord of hoaſts, bleſſed is the man that truſteth in thee,</hi> Pſal. 84.11, 12. then he delights himſelf in the Lord, as the moſt pleaſant and eligible Good thing, as his Sun and his Shield; and accordingly fixes his Contemplations on God, quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens, chears, confirms, raiſes up his Spirits in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of him; expreſſes himſelf in holy Hymns, in devout Prayers, in wiſe Obſervations of his Doings,
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:42122:144"/>in commemorating of his Works and his Word, in holy Conferences, and ſuch like ways, as ſhew that none is ſo amiable to him as God, none to be adhered to in compariſon of him, none to be glorified like unto God.</p>
               <p>Conformably hereto, he delights in the Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God's moſt excellent Being: that he is not like <hi>the Vanities of the Nations:</hi> that <hi>he is the living God, and an everlaſting King:</hi> that <hi>in the Lord Jehovah is everlaſting Strength:</hi> that <hi>there is none holy as the Lord, no Rock like unto our God:</hi> that <hi>great is our Lord, and of great Power, his <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding is infinite:</hi> that he is <hi>mercifull and gracious, abundant in Goodneſs and Truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He delights alſo in the beholding and obſervation of his Works; which however they are not minded by them who are <hi>alienated from the Life that is in God,</hi> yet to the Godly enlightned Soul they appear Great, ſo that in Admiration of them he is affected like the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 8.1. <hi>O Lord our God, how excellent is thy Name in all the Earth, who haſt ſet thy Glory above the Heavens!</hi> Pſal. 104.24. <hi>In wiſedom haſt thou made them all,</hi> and ruleſt all. <hi>He is holy in all his Ways, and righteous in all his Works:</hi> and therefore <hi>are they ſought out of all them that have pleaſure therein. His Work is honourable and glorious; and his Righteouſneſs endureth for ever.</hi> And hereupon the Pſalmiſt reſolves, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.34. <hi>My meditation of him ſhall be ſweet; I will be glad in the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor is his Delight leſs in God's Word then in his Works. <hi>I will praiſe thy Name,</hi> ſaith <hi>David,</hi> (Pſal. 138.2.) <hi>for thy Loving-kindneſs and for thy Truth: for thou haſt magnified thy Word above all thy Name.</hi> And thus he often profeſſeth, that the Word of God, his <hi>Judgments</hi> were <hi>more to be deſired then Gold, yea, then much fine Gold; ſweeter then Hony and the Hony-comb:</hi>
                  <pb n="280" facs="tcp:42122:145"/>that not onely his Word of Promiſe was <hi>his Comfort in his Affliction, for by it he was quickened;</hi> but that he greatly <hi>delighted in God's Commands,</hi> they were <hi>the Joy of his heart:</hi> And Holy <hi>Job,</hi> (23.12.) <hi>I have eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the Word of his mouth more then my neceſſary Food.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But Holy mens greateſt Delight in God is, when by Faith in <hi>Chriſt</hi> they apprehend God to be <hi>their God, and they his People;</hi> that he <hi>dwells in them,</hi> they are <hi>his Temple;</hi> that they are <hi>made by him Kings and Prieſts</hi> to him by his Spirit; that he is their Father through <hi>Chriſt,</hi> they his Children; that they <hi>have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs to him by the Faith of Chriſt,</hi> and are aſſured of an <hi>Inheritance</hi> above with him. When they underſtand this, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> is All to them, they <hi>delight in the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, and lift up their face unto God</hi> with Joy, as it is <hi>Job</hi> 22.26.</p>
               <p>Now this indeed is beſt for the Godly, thus to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light themſelves in the Lord, even in their own loweſt Conditions, and their Oppreſſours higheſt, becauſe the greateſt Good that Evil men have is but vain. Be it Plenty, Peace, Honour, Liberty, Power, Pleaſure, or what-ever elſe is valued by <hi>men that have their Portion in this life,</hi> it is but an imperfect, fading, vexing Good; much of it is ſuch as Beaſts injoy more fully then they, who have more Delight in their Food and ſenſitive Pleaſure then Men have. Applauſe, Honours, Wealth, are but Toys, ſuch as Childiſh perſons delight in rather then wiſe Men. Philoſophers, by the Light of Nature, have cenſured them as empty of reall Worth; not good, becauſe they made not the Poſſeſſours of them good. Wiſedom and Vertue are by them preferred before them. Yea, they bring often much Vexation, in ſtead of Delight. In acquiring and Uſing them is much <hi>Vanity. In the midſt of Laughter, the Heart is ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full; Solomon</hi> ſtyles it <hi>Madneſs.</hi> But Delight in the
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:42122:145"/>Lord is the moſt rationall, exquiſite, durable Delight: far above not onely <hi>Epicurus</hi> his Pleaſure, and <hi>Zeno</hi>'s Vertue, and <hi>Seneca</hi>'s Tranquillity of mind; but alſo <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Glory, his Wiſedom, his Knowledge of the Properties of Natural bodies, and what-ever Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy (ſhort of Acquaintance with God) he was endued with. He confeſſeth as much in the cloſe of his Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentialls: and before him his Father <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 4.6, 7. <hi>There be many that ſay, Who will ſhew us any Good? Lord, lift thou up the light of thy Countenance upon us. Thou haſt put Gladneſs in my Heart, more then in the time that their Corn and their Wine increaſed.</hi> This makes the Saints delight in Prayer and Praiſe, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Worſhip of God; it being their Privilege as well as their Duty to <hi>delight themſelves in the Lord,</hi> Iſa. 58.14. and according to the Deſire of their Heart. Which brings me to the</p>

                  <hi>That they who delight themſelves in the Lord ſhall have their Hearts Deſire, and in fine ſpeed better then they who are in the moſt illuſtrious eſtate of Wicked men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The principal Deſire of one that delights himſelf in God is, to glorifie God: that is the main End of ſuch as glory in God, that they may doe all to his Glory. Therefore are they taught to make this their firſt Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Hallowed be thy Name;</hi> and to that end to pray, <hi>Thy Kingdom come, Thy Will be done on Earth as it is in Heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Even in God's moſt ſevere Dealings with them, they ſay with thoſe <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26.8. <hi>Yea, in the way of thy Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, O Lord, have we waited for thee: the deſire of our Soul is to thy Name, and to the Remembrance of thee.</hi> To which that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.20. is conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant;
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:42122:146"/>
                  <hi>According to my earneſt expectation and my hope, that in nothing I ſhall be aſhamed, but that with all bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as always, ſo now alſo Chriſt ſhall be magnified in my body, whether it be by life, or by death.</hi> That which is ſaid by <hi>David,</hi> but moſt truly verified of our Lord <hi>Chriſt,</hi> is true of all that delight in the Lord, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40.8. <hi>I delight to doe thy Will, O my God; yea, thy Law is within my Heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this their Deſire God always grants: ſo that, however he that delights in the Lord be aſſaulted with Temptations, be benighted in his Apprehenſions of God's Favour, <hi>though Heavineſs may endure for a night, Joy</hi> ſhall <hi>come in the morning;</hi> though he miſs of his Way, yet he ſhall find his Errour, and return into it again. <hi>The Steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord; and he delighteth in his way. Though he fall, he ſhall not be utterly caſt down: for the Lord upholdeth him with his hand,</hi> Pſal. 37.23, 34.</p>
               <p>Next unto theſe ultimate and ſupreme Ends, the Deſire of his Soul who delights in the Lord is, to ſee God. How earneſtly did <hi>Moſes</hi> beg the ſight of God's Face? How often doth <hi>David</hi> bemoan his Abſence from God's Worſhip at his Temple? <hi>As the Hart</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>panteth after the water-brooks, ſo panteth my Soul after thee, O God. My Soul thirſteth for God, for the living God: when ſhall I come and appear before God? Pſal.</hi> 42.1, 2. And in the next Pſalm, verſ. 3. <hi>O ſend out thy Light and thy Truth: let them lead me, let them bring me unto thy holy Hill and to thy Tabernacles.</hi> So Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> Phil. 1.23. <hi>I deſire to depart, and to be with Chriſt, which is beſt of all.</hi> And this Deſire God will give them at laſt who delight in him. <hi>Bleſſed are the pure in heart, for they ſhall ſee God,</hi> Matth. 5.8. <hi>Now are we the Sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we ſhall be: but we know, that when he ſhall appear, we
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:42122:146"/>ſhall be like him; for we ſhall ſee him as he is,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.2. <hi>Manutenentia Divina,</hi> God's ſupporting Grace here, and <hi>Viſio beatifica,</hi> the Fruition of God hereafter, are two grand Deſires of Souls that delight in God; theſe they petition for, and he will grant them both.</p>
               <p>There are other Deſires which they have, as the Proſperity of God's Church, the Downfall of their Enemies; which the Lord will alſo at laſt accompliſh, though not without much Contention, and long Wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. They ſhall overcome <hi>the Powers of darkneſs,</hi> and the World; they ſhall ſee the people of God above their Enemies, <hi>by the bloud of the Lamb, and by the word of their Teſtimony,</hi> though they lay down their <hi>Lives</hi> for it.</p>
               <p>Other Deſires of outward Bleſſings God grants not always in the kind, but often in ſome Equivalent. He repairs that which they loſe for <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his Goſpell, by inward Comfort and Spirituall Strength. Though they be in <hi>Want,</hi> or under Perſecution, yet they <hi>know how to abound,</hi> in that they <hi>have learned in whatſoever eſtate therewith to be content.</hi> They <hi>can doe all things through Chriſt that ſtrengtheneth them.</hi> If they have <hi>a Thorn in the Fleſh, a Meſſenger of Satan to buffet them,</hi> and it ſtill moleſt them; yet <hi>the Grace of God</hi> is not denied them, and it <hi>is ſufficient for them; his Strength is perfected in their Weakneſs.</hi> Many Deſires of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Bleſſings are granted them; and this one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive Privilege belongs to them, that <hi>all things work together for good to them who love God,</hi> Rom. 8.28.</p>

               <p>As theſe mens Hearts are not towards God, ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is God's towards them: they have no Pleaſure in God, nor God in them. How many of you are there of whom thoſe things are verified which we reade <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58.2. <hi>They ſeek me daily, and delight to know my ways, as a Nation that did Righteouſneſs, and forſook not the Ordinance of their God: they ask for the Ordinances of Juſtice, they take Delight in approaching to God?</hi> and yet for want of reall Delighting in God, it may be your lot at laſt to hear <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſay to you, <hi>I know you not: depart from me, you workers of Iniquity.</hi> Is it not true of you, which the Prophet ſaid of his Hearers, that <hi>they came and ſate before</hi> the Prophet, <hi>as God s

            <p>The Apoſtle in the beginning of the foregoing Chapter acquaints the Chriſtian <hi>Jews</hi> in the Diſperſion with the great Preferments and Emoluments they had by <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and after applies himſelf to direct them in ſome ſpecial Duties, which he begins at verſ. 11. of that Chapter. <hi>Officium ſequitur Beneficium;</hi> Benefits by <hi>Chriſt</hi> require Duties ſutable to <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Precepts and Example. Particularly in this Chapter, verſ. 8, 9. you have Unity, Mercy, Love and Courteouſneſs commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded;
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:42122:149"/>evil Deeds and evil Speech forbidden; Bleſſing of God and Men injoyned.

            <p>Now this is propoſed by way of Interrogation, which uſually implies a peremptory Negation; <hi>Who will harm you?</hi> that is, <hi>None will harm you,</hi> or, <hi>None ſhall be able to harm you.</hi> Which cannot be underſtood abſolutely and univerſally, as if in no caſe any could or would harm them that follow that which is Good.

As when it is ſaid, <hi>A good Tree cannot bring forth bad Fruit,</hi> that is, it doth not ſo uſually or frequently. So here, Men uſually do not harm Sheep, but let them feed quietly: Men do not ordinarily vex them that are ſtudious of Good. But as men hunt after Foxes and Wolves, and other ravenous Beaſts; ſo do they <hi>cry after a Thief,</hi> Job 30.5. they purſue after <hi>Murtherers, Thieves, Malefactours, Buſie-bodies in other mens matters,</hi> 1 Pet. 4.15.</p>

They were not the <hi>true Riches,</hi> verſ. 11. nor that which was indeed <hi>his own,</hi> verſ. 12. but that which he had onely for a while, by permiſſion. As the Quails were given to the <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites</hi> in wrath; as good Paſture ſerves to fatten Beaſts which are fed for the Slaughter: ſo are theſe ſeeming Good things oftentimes beſtowed on Wicked men, but it is to their Ruine at laſt. <hi>Ye have lived in pleaſure on the earth, and been wanton; ye have nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:42122:150"/>your hearts as in a day of ſlaughter,</hi> ſaith S. <hi>James,</hi> (5.5.)</p>
               <p>This <hi>Bonum <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tile</hi> and <hi>Jucundum,</hi> Profit and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, carnal and worldly men count their Good things: like him that flattered himſelf in his Folly, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.19. <hi>Soul, thou haſt much Goods laid up for many years;</hi> though they were indeed his Poiſon, the Bait where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by his Soul was caught by Satan, and himſelf cenſured for an egregious <hi>Fool.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is another ſort of Good that is really ſuch <hi>in genere Entis:</hi> and ſo all God's Creatures are good. <hi>God ſaw every thing that he had made, and behold, it was very good,</hi> Gen. 1.31. Another <hi>in genere Moris,</hi> a Good which makes the perſon truly good. Such is the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God, <hi>who is good, and doeth good,</hi> Pſal. 119.68. even by communicating Good to all, <hi>Act.</hi> 14.17. And indeed He is the chiefeſt Good: He is moſt tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently, perfectly, originally Good; <hi>from whom every good and every perfect Gift cometh,</hi> James 1.17. And therefore rightly is it ſaid by our Lord <hi>Chriſt,</hi> Matth. 19.17. <hi>There is none good but one, that is God.</hi> And this Good we are to be Followers of: <hi>Be ye Followers of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is alſo a derivative Goodneſs from him, which is communicated primitively to his Son, concerning whom <hi>it is the Father's pleaſure, that in him ſhould all Fulneſs dwell,</hi> Col. 1.19. <hi>The Spirit is given him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out meaſure,</hi> Joh. 3.34. While he was upon Earth, <hi>he went about doing good,</hi> Act. 10.38. He might truly ſay, <hi>I am the good Shepherd,</hi> Joh. 10.11. And from him Good is redundant to us. He hath <hi>plenitudinem Fon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis,</hi> and not onely <hi>Vaſis: With him is the fountain of Life,</hi> and <hi>in his Light we ſee light,</hi> Pſal. 36.9. Now the Good we are to be Followers of is alſo this Good which is in and from <hi>Chriſt:</hi> the Good of his Word,
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:42122:151"/>to know it; the Good of his Example, to imitate it; the Good of his <hi>Gifts,</hi> (the Gifts of his Spirit,) to be <hi>zealous after them,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.31. the Good of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs and eternall Life which is from God by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> to injoy it; the Good of God's Favour in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> to obtain it; the Good of <hi>Communion with the Father and the Son,</hi> to embrace it.</p>
               <p>But though theſe ſorts of Good are to be followed, yet that which we are here required more ſpecially to be Followers of, is not ſo much <hi>Bonum Beatitudinis,</hi> the Good of Bleſſedneſs for our ſelves, as <hi>Bonum San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctitatis,</hi> the Good of Holineſs, whereby we may be like unto God, <hi>be holy as he is holy,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.15, 16. and <hi>Bonum Juſtitiae,</hi> the Good of Righteouſneſs, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards our ſelves and others, ſuch as may conſiſt with a <hi>good Conſcience,</hi> and <hi>a good Converſation</hi> in <hi>Chriſt;</hi> the Good of Innocency, that we may be <hi>blameleſs and harmleſs, the ſons of God, without rebuke,</hi> Phil. 2.15. the Good of Benevolence and Beneficence, willing and procuring good unto all, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.10. <hi>as we have opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, doing good to all, eſpecially unto them that are of the houſhold of Faith.</hi> We muſt endeavour after the good Heart, that may <hi>out of its Treaſure bring forth good things,</hi> Matth. 12.35. after the good Tongue, that <hi>ſpeaketh Wiſedom, and talketh of Judgment,</hi> Pſal. 37.30. that uttereth <hi>that which is good to the uſe of Edifying, that it may miniſter Grace to the hearers,</hi> Eph. 4.29. af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the good Hand, that may <hi>work the thing that is good, that it may have to give to him that needeth,</hi> v. 28.

               <p n="2">II. <hi>How this Good is to be followed.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="293" facs="tcp:42122:151"/>
               <p n="1">1. Univerſally; all the Kinds of it are to be purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: not onely the Good of Religion towards God, but alſo of Love towards Man. The End of our <hi>Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance from the hands of our Enemies</hi> is, that <hi>we might ſerve God in Holineſs and Righteouſneſs before him all the days of our life;</hi> as it is in the <hi>Benedictus,</hi> Luk. 1.74, 75. <hi>The Grace of God hath appeared to all men, tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching them, that denying <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngodlineſs and worldly Luſts, they ſhould live righteouſly, ſoberly and godly in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent world,</hi> Tit. 2.11, 12. We know it is S. <hi>James</hi> his determination, (2.10.) <hi>Whoſoever ſhall keep the whole Law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all.</hi> Vertues are chained together, the Law is copulative: <hi>Bonum non niſt ex integra cauſa;</hi> He that is not intire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly good, is not good at all. He that is all for the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of Religious Ordinances, but no whit for Charity; he that is devout at Church, but proud, vain, wanton, uncharitable, unrighteous, intemperate at home; is no <hi>Follower of that which is Good,</hi> but an Hypocrite, a meer <hi>Phariſee,</hi> or <hi>painted Sepulchre.</hi> And he that is much for Alms, and Abſtinence from Exceſs, or prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited Pleaſures, yet careleſs of Prayer, Reading, Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring God's Word, in publick and in private, is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane perſon; be he never ſo much eſteemed by men, yet is he abominable before God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Nor muſt we be Followers of all Sorts of Good onely, but alſo of all kinds of Good in the moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Degree. What the Apoſtle prays for in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> Col. 1.9, 10. ſhould be the aim of every ſincere Chriſtian, that <hi>he may be filled with the knowledge of God's Will in all wiſedom and ſpiritual un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding;</hi> that <hi>he may walk worthy of the Lord un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all pleaſing, being faithfull in every good work, and increaſing in the knowledge of God.</hi> So what he prays for in behalf of the <hi>Philippians,</hi> Phil. 1.11. that <hi>he may be
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:42122:152"/>filled with the Fruits of Righteouſneſs, which are by Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt unto the glory and praiſe of God:</hi> that he may be <hi>abundant in the work of the Lord,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.58. As he is unjuſt that lets not the Buier have his full Meaſure: ſo is he that doth not afford God the utmoſt of his Service, that doth not <hi>love him with all his Mind, with all his Soul, and with all his Strength.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this an Emulation is good, which is implied in the word <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as ſome Copies have it in my Text; and it is ſo rendred by <hi>Beza.</hi> We ſhould vie one with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, as deſirous to outſtrip each other; like Runners in a Race, that ſtrive who ſhall run faſteſt. Yea, in this it is good to be ſingular. <hi>If ye ſalute your Brethren onely,</hi> ſaith <hi>Chriſt,</hi> (<hi>Matth.</hi> 5.47.) <hi>what ſingular thing,</hi> or <hi>more then others, doe ye?</hi> intimating, that a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an that exceeds not a Philoſopher or a <hi>Jew,</hi> is not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of that name. He muſt not onely <hi>doe good</hi> to them that love him, but even <hi>to them that hate him,</hi> verſ. 44. Though we own no Popiſh Evangelical Counſels, no Monkiſh Vows, as putting a man into a ſtate of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, no Merit or Works of Supererogation: yet he that will approve himſelf to God muſt endeavour to doe thoſe Good works that are commanded to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, <hi>Extenſivè,</hi> Works of all Kinds, and <hi>Intenſivè,</hi> in all their Degrees, according to his ability.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And this we are to doe ſincerely, as before God; <hi>not as pleaſing Men, but God that trieth the heart,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.4. Not like the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> who gave Alms, Faſted, Prayed, <hi>that they might be ſeen of Men,</hi> and therefore did all with Oſtentation; but in ſecret and private as well as in publick we ſhould be Followers of that which is Good, looking onely at God's Glory, our O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to him, and the pleaſing of him, as our End. Inſomuch that, if we can acquit our ſelves ſo as to have his Favour and good Liking of us, we muſt not
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:42122:152"/>care what we loſe, or what Obloquy, Cenſure, or Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace we incurro from men. Our <hi>Righteouſneſs and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs</hi> ſhould not be in ſhew, but in <hi>truth,</hi> Eph. 4.24.</p>
               <p n="4">4. In Following of that which is Good, we ſhould doe it zealouſly, with our Minds, our Affections, and our Studies. We ſhould <hi>give all diligence</hi> and ſtudy that we may abound in <hi>Faith, Vertue, Knowledge, Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, Patience, Godlineſs, Brotherly love, Charity,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.5, 6, 7. We ſhould <hi>follow Peace with all men, and Holineſs,</hi> Heb. 12.14. purſue after it, as Hunters after a Prey, or Enemies after Enemies. <hi>This one thing I doe;</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.13, 14.) <hi>forgetting the things that are behind, and reaching forth unto thoſe things that are before, I preſs,</hi> or <hi>purſue, towards the Mark, for the price of the high Calling of God in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> A lazy ſlack Following of Good is ineffectual: ſuch a Seeking as the old Saints are ſaid to have uſed is that which is required of them that will <hi>inherit the Promiſes,</hi> Heb. 6.11, 12.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Yea, we ſhould not onely follow that which is Good our ſelves, but animate others to follow it too. He loves not God, nor his Brother, that ſeeing him in Want, doth not relieve him when it is in his power: ſo neither doth he follow God, that ſeeing his Brother erre, doth not, as he hath opportunity, endeavour to <hi>convert him from the Errour of his ways;</hi> that doth not <hi>lift up the hands that hang down, and the feeble knees, Heb.</hi> 12.12. that doth not avoid giving ſuch Offence as may cauſe the Lame to fall in the way, or to turn out of it; that doth not encourage others in that which is Good, comfort and heal the ſorrowfull Spirit, and lead others by Example, Inſtruction, and Prayer. Such as are <hi>of God, doe good,</hi> even as he doeth, who benefits all, invites all, is <hi>Bonum univerſale,</hi> an univerſal com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municative Good.</p>
               <pb n="296" facs="tcp:42122:153"/>
               <p n="6">6. Our following of Good muſt be with Conſtancy. We muſt <hi>always be zealous in a good thing,</hi> Gal. 4.18. all our days, in youth and age; in all Companies, in all E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, on all Occaſions: not by ſits and ſtarts. We muſt <hi>cleave to that which is good,</hi> Rom. 12.9. as a Wife adheres to her Husband, as <hi>Ruth</hi> did to her Mother-in-law. We ſhould <hi>be ſtedfaſt and unmovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord; as knowing that our labour ſhall not be in vain in the Lord,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.58. Which brings me to the other Particulars propounded to be conſidered: in which I ſhall be very brief.</p>
               <p n="3">III. <hi>The Harm that they who are zealous Followers of that which is Good are ſecured from.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is indeed all ſorts of Evils: the chief whereof are the Wounds of Conſcience, and the Wrath of God. While men follow that which is Good, they are not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to thoſe Laſhes of a guilty Conſcience, which are conſequent upon the remembrance of lewd Pranks in youth, Deceits and Covetous practices in age, cruel Murthers, horrid Perjuries, unjuſt Bribes, Purloining, Stealing, and ſuch other Evils as do <hi>vaſtare Conſcienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am,</hi> violently torture the Mind, and are as ſcorching Heat in a man's Bones, Gall and Wormwood in his Belly; as when God <hi>wrote bitter things againſt Job, and made him poſſeſs the Sins of his youth.</hi> Theſe Tortures were reſembled in the Poets by the Affrightments of Furies, and are Forerunners of Hell-Torments. Nor ſhall thoſe who follow what is Good be liable to the <hi>Indignation and Wrath, Tribulation and Anguiſh,</hi> which God inflicts on <hi>them that are contentious, and obey not the Truth, but obey <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrighteouſneſs,</hi> Rom. 2.8, 9. Theſe are indeed the grand Harms, that are like the ſtinging of a Scorpion: but my Text intends likewiſe all Afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions incident to us from mens Injuriouſneſs and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity, ſuch as are Reproaches, Deriſion, Slanders,
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:42122:153"/>privation of Liberty, Livelihood, Life: which though they be but Flea-bitings in compariſon of the other, yet are they very harmfull, as being extreme trouble-ſome and grievous. Yet by Following of that which is Good, there is Security from them, if not altogether, at leaſt in a great meaſure; if not from the Feeling of them, yet from the Oppreſſion of them; if not from the Buzzing and Diſquieting of them, as of Flies, yet from the Sting of them, as of Scorpions; if not from the Moleſtation of them, yet from the Deadlineſs of them: which will be better diſcerned, if we conſider our next Particular.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. <hi>Who they are from whoſe Harming they are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They are either Men, or Devils; neither of whom can mortally and eternally wound us. <hi>Fear not them</hi> (ſaith our Lord) <hi>that can kill the Body, and when they have done that, can doe no more: but fear him that can caſt both Soul and Body into Hell-ſire,</hi> Matth. 10.28. <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.4. Men and Devils may interrupt our Peace, but cannot damn our Souls. Neither <hi>Tribulation,</hi> nor <hi>Diſtreſs,</hi> nor <hi>Perſecution,</hi> nor <hi>Famine,</hi> nor <hi>Nakedneſs,</hi> nor <hi>Peril,</hi> nor <hi>Sword, neither Death, nor Life, nor An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, nor Principalities, nor Powers, nor things preſent, nor things to come, nor Height, nor Depth, nor any other Creature, can ſeparate</hi> them that follow that which is Good <hi>from the Love of God which is in Chriſt Jeſus our Lord.</hi> But <hi>in all theſe things</hi> they <hi>are more then Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querours through him that hath loved</hi> them: as S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith of himſelf, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.35, 37, 38, 39. Yet are they ſorely aſſaulted by both theſe Enemies: inſomuch that the Apoſtle tells us there, verſ. 36. <hi>for God's ſake they are killed all the day long, and are counted as Sheep for the ſlaughter.</hi> They are <hi>as Sheep among Wolves,</hi> who are ready to worry them. Satan <hi>caſts ſome into Priſon ten
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:42122:154"/>days, that they may be tried,</hi> Rev. 12.10. He <hi>goes about, like a roaring Lion, ſeeking whom he may devour,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.8. There is a ſpitefull Spirit in all that are <hi>of the Wicked one;</hi> yet ſometimes God <hi>reſtrains the remainder of their Wrath. He cuts off the ſpirit of Princes, he is terrible to the Kings of the earth,</hi> Pſal. 76.10, 12. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bukes an <hi>Abimelech</hi> in a Dream, ſo as that he dares not <hi>touch</hi> them, <hi>Gen.</hi> 20.6. <hi>He ſuffers no man to doe them wrong; he reproves Kings for their ſake, ſaying, Touch not mine Anointed, and doe my Prophets no harm,</hi> Pſal. 105.14, 15. <hi>When a man's ways pleaſe the Lord, he maketh even his Enemies to be at peace with him,</hi> Prov. 16.7. Sometimes the Luſter of a Good life doth either attract the favourable Aſpect, or dazzle the Eyes of thoſe with whom they live. Sometimes the benefit of Laws and Government ſecures their Peace: they are <hi>Miniſters to them for good,</hi> Rom. 13.4. By theſe and many more means are they that follow that which is Good indemnified; whenas <hi>his own Iniquities take the Wicked himſelf, and he is holden with the Chords of his Sins,</hi> Prov. 5.22.</p>
               <p n="5">V. <hi>When it is that they are ſecured.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But then this is not perpetually ſo; it falleth out ſometimes otherwiſe. <hi>When the Wicked beareth rule,</hi> in Times of Anarchy or Tyranny, there is not this Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to them that follow Good, but <hi>the people mourn. There is a Juſt man that periſheth in his Righteouſneſs, and there is a Wicked man that prolongeth his life in his Wickedneſs,</hi> Eccles. 7.15. When <hi>cedunt Armis Togae,</hi> men of the long Robe are awed by men of the long Sword, the people are hurried up and down by popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Oratours, Demagogues ſway with them, and they controll their Governours; when an Uſurper gets into the Throne, and, to ſtrengthen his Party, ſuppreſſeth the beſt and wiſeſt; when thundring Cannons are
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:42122:154"/>heard, and juſt Laws are ſilenc'd; when the Magiſtrate's Sword ſubmits to the Souldier's, the Judges yield to the Commanders of forces; when the Preachers lead the People, not by the Word of God, but by the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of Men; then it is likely, in ſuch an Iron Age, (wherein <hi>non Hoſpes ab Hoſpite tutus,</hi>) to follow that which is Good may be a man's greateſt Danger, to ſpeak truth may be his Ruine. <hi>When the wicked riſe, men hide themſelves,</hi> Prov. 28.28. <hi>Bene qui latuit, bene vixit:</hi> He is the wiſeſt that lives moſt retired.</p>
               <p>The like may be ſaid of Times of Perſecution, when God will have his people to be under <hi>fiery Trialls,</hi> that their <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Patience</hi> may appear; when God will be glorified in their Sufferings, as well as honoured by their Doings. Yet in theſe caſes, he <hi>keeps them in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Peace whoſe Mind is ſtayed on God, becauſe they truſt in him,</hi> Iſa. 26.3. While they <hi>hold Faith and a good Conſcience,</hi> and <hi>make</hi> no <hi>ſhipwreck</hi> of them, <hi>the Peace of God, which paſſeth all underſtanding, guards their hearts and minds through Chriſt Jeſus. Hic Murus aheneus.</hi> Yea, even in time of univerſal Loſs, in ſuch Sufferings as <hi>Job</hi>'s, they find <hi>an hundred-fold</hi> advantage <hi>with Perſecution, and in the end everlaſting Life:</hi> ſo that they <hi>who kill the Body,</hi> haſten the Salvation of their Souls; and by diſpatching them hence, they ſpeed them in their flight to Heaven. Of which yet they are not the proper Cauſe; but there is an higher Cauſe, who is able to bring Good out of Evil. Which was the laſt thing to be conſidered.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. <hi>Why they are thus ſecured.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is God's Eye and his Hand that do ſecure and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnifie thoſe that are Followers of that which is Good. This Reaſon of their Security the Coherence of my Text with the words next before yields me: for having ſaid, <hi>The Eyes of the Lord are over the Righteous,
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:42122:155"/>and his Ears are open unto their Prayers: but the Face of the Lord is againſt them that doe Evil;</hi> he ſubjoyns my Text, <hi>And who is he that will</hi> (I had rather ſay, <hi>ſhall</hi>) <hi>harm you, if ye be Followers of that which is Good?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>While you are in his Service, God counts himſelf en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to take you into his Protection. And therefore he will either change the Hearts of your Adverſaries, that they ſhall not mind the harming of you; as he promiſed the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> Exod. 34.24. that <hi>no man ſhould deſire their Land, when they ſhould goe up to appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord thrice in the year;</hi> though then were (in the eye of Reaſon) a fit ſeaſon for them to make an hoſtile and ſucceſsfull Invaſion: or elſe he will divert them, as he did <hi>Saul,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.28. or diſable them, as he did <hi>Pharaoh:</hi> or if they be permitted to harm you outwardly, God will comfort you inwardly; and in fine, <hi>all things ſhall work together for good to thoſe that love God,</hi> and are <hi>Followers of that which is Good.</hi> And thus they ſhall be as the Three Children in the midſt of the fiery Furnace, and yet have no Harm. And in this reſpect the Concluſion is made good, None doth, none will, or none ſhall <hi>harm</hi> them that are <hi>Followers of that which is Good.</hi>

This may be a good Encouragement to you all, to follow that which is Good; to <hi>exerciſe</hi> your ſelves, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> did, <hi>Act.</hi> 24.16. <hi>to have always a Conſcience void of offence towards God and towards Men.</hi> At all times, ſpecially in troublous Times, every man is bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie in projecting and contriving how to find an <hi>Aſylum</hi> or Sanctuary, where he may be ſafe from Danger, and find Shelter from <hi>the Enemy and Avenger.</hi> One fortifies his Houſe: another ſtrengthens himſelf by Alliances:
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:42122:155"/>another arms himſelf, and gets into the field: another relies on the Favour of the Grandees in Court, or Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, or City: another gets together what Gold or Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he can, to procure his Peace at home, or provide for Subſiſtence abroad.

               <p>Were men contented with their own, did they defraud none, but apply themſelves to works of Righteouſneſs and Mercy; they might enjoy themſelves and God with more freedom.

            <p>THESE words are the Cloſe of a Pſalm, which is thus entituled, <hi>Michtam of David,</hi> that is, <hi>A golden Pſalm of David,</hi> or <hi>David's Jewel,</hi> or <hi>notable Song. Cethem</hi> is fine glittering Gold; from whence this word <hi>Michtam</hi> may be derived, for a gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Jewel, and ſo note the Excellency of this Pſalm. The like Title is before other Pſalms, <hi>viz.</hi> 56.57.58.59.60. Nor is the Title unfit for the Matter, or unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeming the Authour. The Matter being moſt precious, containing that <hi>Gold tried in the fire,</hi> which <hi>Chriſt</hi> gives, and with it enricheth his Church to all Eternity; that <hi>Aurum potabile</hi> that cures and preſerves Life for
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:42122:158"/>ever. Congruous to <hi>David</hi>'s Spirit, who was a man of much Acquaintance with God, and of Heavenly Meditations.</p>
            <p>But that may be demanded concerning this Pſalm, which the Eunuch asked of <hi>Philip,</hi> Act. 8.34. <hi>Of whom ſpeaketh the Prophet this? of himſelf, or of ſome other man?</hi> There are that conceive this Pſalm wholly meant of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and not of <hi>David:</hi> others, that part is meant of <hi>Chriſt</hi> onely, and not of <hi>David:</hi> others, that all is meant of both: others, that part is meant of <hi>David</hi> onely, and not of <hi>Chriſt</hi> at all. I will not interpoſe in this matter.</p>
            <p>It is ſufficient for my preſent purpoſe, that S. <hi>Paul, Act.</hi> 13.35, 36, 37. makes the tenth verſe of this Pſalm proper to <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and S. <hi>Peter,</hi> Act. 2.25, 26, 27, 28. makes the four laſt verſes thereof to be a Prediction of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Reſurrection, not applicable to <hi>David,</hi> who ſaw Corruption, as his Sepulcher then remaining wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed. Now of thoſe my Text is cited as a part; and therefore it may be ſafely interpreted as the Speech of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in an Addreſs to God his Father, in which he opened his very Heart, declaring the Reaſon why he was not moved by that Tempeſt and terrible Storm of Evils that he was to feel; how he was kept from ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, notwithſtanding thoſe Flouds and Waves that were to goe over his head; why he deſpaired not in that great Earthquake, that threw the Temple of his Body to the ground: to wit, Becauſe <hi>he ſet the Lord,</hi> or <hi>foreſaw the Lord, always before him,</hi> or <hi>before his face;</hi> that <hi>he was at</hi> or <hi>on his right hand,</hi> that <hi>he ſhould not be moved: Therefore did his Heart rejoyce, and his Glory,</hi> or Tongue, <hi>was glad; his Fleſh ſhould reſt,</hi> or <hi>dwell confidently, in hope:</hi> he being by Faith aſſured, that his Father <hi>would not leave his Soul in Hell,</hi> in the place or ſtate of the Dead, though he deſcended into
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:42122:158"/>it, <hi>nor ſuffer,</hi> or <hi>give, his Holy one</hi> (ſo dear to him) <hi>to ſee Corruption;</hi> but had <hi>made known to him the ways of Life,</hi> or <hi>would ſhew to him the path of Life,</hi> in raiſing him up to Life; and that he <hi>would make him full of Joy with his Countenance,</hi> as S. <hi>Peter</hi> reads it, or, as it is in our Verſion, (according to the <hi>Hebrew,</hi>) that <hi>in his preſence was fulneſs of Joy, at his right hand there were Pleaſures for evermore.</hi> Word for word, it may be rendred, <hi>Thou wilt make me know the way of Life, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiety of Joys before thy face, Pleaſures at thy right hand to perpetuity.</hi> In which ſenſe the words are to the ſame effect with what the Authour to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> ſpeaks, (12.2.) <hi>Looking to Jeſus, the Authour and Finiſher of our Faith, who, for the Joy that was ſet before him, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured the Croſs, deſpiſing the Shame, and is ſet down at the right hand of the Throne of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus ſecondarily theſe words might be <hi>David</hi>'s, and every Holy Believer's, in a qualified ſenſe, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſſured of Reſtitution from Hell, of freedom from Corruption of their Fleſh, of finding the Path of Life, of Satiety of Joy with God, and Perpetuity of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures at his right hand, in like manner as <hi>Chriſt</hi> found in his Refurrection; they being <hi>quickened together with him, raiſed up together, and made to ſit together in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly places in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> Eph. 2.5, 6. and thereby animated, under all Perſecutions and Sufferings, to perſiſt in their Adherence to their God unmovably, as being aſſured of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Reſurrection, and thereby of their own; of his being in Fulneſs of Joys in God's preſence, and ſo of their own being; of his being at the right hand of God with Pleaſures which endure for ever, and conſequently that it ſhall be ſo with them. Of which we have a moſt admirable Example in Holy <hi>Job,</hi> who, though under extreme Pains of Body and Anguiſh of Spirit, yet thus expreſſeth himſelf, <hi>Job</hi> 19.23,
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:42122:159"/>24, 25, 26, 27. <hi>Oh that my words were now written, Oh that they were printed in a Book; that they were gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven with an iron Pen and Lead in the Rock for ever. For I know that my Redeemer liveth, and that he ſhall ſtand at the latter day upon the Earth. And though after my Skin, Worms deſtroy this Body; yet in my Fleſh ſhall I ſee God: Whom I ſhall ſee for my ſelf, and mine Eyes ſhall behold, and not another; though my Reins be conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med within me.</hi> And thus joyntly of the Head and Members, <hi>Chriſt</hi> and every Believer, is my Text veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and rightly underſtood; and accordingly I ſhall apply it.</p>
            <p>Therein is declared the Aſſurance which <hi>Chriſt</hi> had, and every Believer (together with him, and by reaſon of his Union with him) hath of three things.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Life</hi> is the manner of Living things exiſting, and is the Excellency of their Beings, whereby things animate differ from things inanimate. Of Life there are ſundry degrees or kinds made by Philoſophers. 1. Vegetative, in Plants, and things which being rooted in the Earth ſuck their Nouriſhment from it, and ſo grow thereby, and yield Fruit, and Seed to propagate their Kind. 2. Senſitive, in thoſe living things that move and have Senſe more or leſs, though they perceive onely ſuch things as concern their Suſtenance and Self-preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but can neither diſcern Spiritualls or Univerſalls, nor reflect on their own Actions, nor diſcourſe as Man: though ſome of them have admirable Sagacity, as Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience hath ſhewed in Elephants and divers other A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals. 3. Rationall, in a Man, whereby he is enabled not onely to know what concerns his Food and Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries to uphold his Corporall Being; but is alſo ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of Counſell and Inſtruction in things pertaining to his Obedience to his Creatour, and Peace with him, and Comfort in his well-doing. 4. There is yet an higher Life, to wit, that of Angels, who need no Food to ſuſtain their Being, nor Members to move them, but are of a ſubtile, active and intelligent Nature; yet much ſhort of the Father of Spirits, <hi>with whom is the Fountain of Life,</hi> (as it is ſaid <hi>Pſal.</hi> 36.9.) who hath all Fulneſs of Life in him, not capable either of dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution or privation; and is the univerſall Cauſe of all Life in other Beings, which he imparts to all living things in that way and meaſure as he thinks beſt to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertain to them.</p>
               <p>Now the Life of Men or Angels may note the bare
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:42122:160"/>Duration or Exiſtence of their Being: and ſo the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils live, and the Souls of the Damned have Life; and the uncleaneſt <hi>Sodomites,</hi> while they walk up and down on Earth, have Life, though in a morall ſenſe they are <hi>dead while alive:</hi> they have alſo in ſome things a <hi>bene eſſe,</hi> or well-being, to wit, in reſpect of ſuch things as pertain to Nature, or outward Condition among men; as <hi>Abraham</hi> ſaid to the Rich man in Hell, <hi>Son, remember that thou in thy life-time receivedſt thy good things,</hi> Luk. 16.25.</p>
               <p>But this is not the Life, the Path, which <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his Members aſſure themſelves God would make known to them; though it be not excluded: for doubtleſs <hi>David</hi> aſſured himſelf, and therein rejoyced, that God would <hi>uphold his Soul</hi> in Life, <hi>deliver his Soul from Death, his Eyes from Tears, and his Feet from Falling;</hi> that he ſhould <hi>walk before the Lord in the Land of the living:</hi> as he ſpeaks <hi>Pſal.</hi> 116.8, 9. And <hi>Chriſt</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by the Life which he expected from his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that he would bring his Soul and Body together again, and reſtore that Life he loſt by Death. And the Saints believe and expect the Reſurrection of their Bodies from the Grave: and in the expectation and aſſurance hereof, they endure the greateſt Tortures that Tyrants can inflict on them: as it is ſaid <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.35. <hi>Women received their dead raiſed to life again; and others were tortured, not accepting Deliverance, that they might obtain a better Reſurrection.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But this Reſurrection to Life is not the mere Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction of Soul and Body together; for that may be onely <hi>the Reſurrection of Damnation,</hi> (as our Saviour ſpeaks <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.29.) which befalls them that have done Evil, and is there oppoſed to <hi>the Reſurrection of Life,</hi> which they onely that have done Good ſhall be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of. The Reſurrection of Damnation, though it
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:42122:160"/>be with Reſtitution of the Being thoſe Wretches had before they died, ſo as that they <hi>ſhall come out of the Graves, hear the voice of the Son of man,</hi> and in a ſort live, <hi>ſtand before the Tribunal of Chriſt,</hi> and hear their Sentence, and ſo continue in their Being everlaſtingly; yet it is not termed <hi>Life,</hi> but <hi>Death,</hi> or <hi>the Second Death,</hi> it being to a Copartnerſhip <hi>with the Devil and his Angels,</hi> with whom they are ſentenced to be <hi>in Torments,</hi> as they were guided and ruled by them while they converſed with men on Earth.</p>
               <p>But the Life which the Scripture vouchſafes to term Life indeed, as being the onely <hi>Vita vitalis,</hi> the lively Life, is that which is with God, and according to God, termed therefore <hi>the Life of God,</hi> Epheſ. 4.18. God being their God, therefore they live to God, who is <hi>the God of the living;</hi> as our Saviour's expreſſion is, <hi>Luk.</hi> 20.38. they <hi>live and reign with Chriſt,</hi> as it is <hi>Revel.</hi> 20.4. It is an holy and happy Life, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſimply termed <hi>Life</hi> by way of excellency, in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to <hi>Hell-fire,</hi> Mark 9.45. <hi>If thy Foot offend thee, cut it off: it is better for thee to enter into Life halting, then having two feet, to be caſt into Hell, into the ſire that never ſhall be quenched.</hi> Verſ. 47. it is termed <hi>the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God; And if thine Eye offend thee, pluck it out: it is better for thee to enter into the Kingdom of God with one Eye, then having two Eyes, to be caſt into Hell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fire.</hi> It is by our Saviour often called <hi>Eternall Life,</hi> of which the Regenerate Believers have the beginning here, they have it inchoate, with a Right to it. <hi>Verily, verily, I ſay unto you,</hi> (ſaith our Saviour, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.24.) <hi>He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that ſent me, hath everlaſting Life, and ſhall not come into Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, but is paſſed from Death to Life.</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.14. <hi>We know that we have paſſed from Death to Life, becauſe we love the Brethren: he that loveth not his Brother,
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:42122:161" rendition="simple:additions"/>abideth in Death.</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.11, 12. <hi>And this is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, that God hath given to us eternal Life: and this Life is in his Son. He that hath the Son, hath Life: and he that hath not the Son of God, hath not Life.</hi> Joh. 3.36. <hi>He that believeth on the Son, hath everlaſting Life: and he that believeth not the Son, ſhall not ſee Life, but the wrath of God abideth on him.</hi> But <hi>Jus in re,</hi> or the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummation and full Poſſeſſion of this Life, is after the Reſurrection, in the World to come: which therefore <hi>Chriſt</hi> by way of Excellency terms <hi>eternall Life,</hi> Mark 10.30.</p>
               <p>And this is that Life, in the aſſurance whereof <hi>Chriſt</hi> laid down his Life with ſo much quietneſs, when he <hi>commended his Spirit into the hands of his Father,</hi> Luk. 23.46. And upon <hi>the promiſe of Life which is in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.1. not onely of <hi>the Life that now is,</hi> but alſo of <hi>that which is to come,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8. S. <hi>Paul</hi> did <hi>both labour and ſuffer Reproach,</hi> verſ. 10. <hi>In hope of</hi> this <hi>eternall Life,</hi> Tit. 1.2. he expoſed himſelf to daily danger of Death, which he terms <hi>dying daily,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.31. as being ſenſible, (as he ſaith verſ. 19.) <hi>if in this life onely he</hi> and other Chriſtians <hi>had hope in Chriſt, they were of all men moſt miſerable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now in hope and aſſurance of this Life <hi>Chriſt (du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram ſerviit Servitutem)</hi> underwent the hardeſt Service that ever was undertaken; he <hi>emptied himſelf, took up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him the form of a Servant, was made in the likeneſs of Men, and being found in faſhion as a Man, he humbled himſelf, and became obedient unto Death, even the death of the Croſs,</hi> Phil. 2.7, 8. Though the Cup he was to drink of were a very bitter Cup, a Cup of deadly Wine, ſuch as had in it the Dregs of God's Anger, and was mingled with the Sins of men, (for whom God <hi>made him Sin,</hi> or a <hi>Sacrifice for Sin;</hi>) yet he drank it off, yielding to his Father's Will, as knowing it to be true
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:42122:161"/>which he himſelf taught the two Diſciples, that <hi>Chriſt muſt ſuffer theſe things, and riſe from the dead the third day, and ſo enter into his Glory,</hi> Luk. 24.26, 46.</p>
               <p>And the Promiſe of this Life animated all the Holy Apoſtles, Martyrs and Saints, in their ſeverall Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to <hi>give all diligence,</hi> to <hi>deny themſelves,</hi> to <hi>take up their Croſs, and</hi> ſo to <hi>follow Chriſt</hi> even to Death, not counting their own Lives dear to them, but being zealous to doe and ſuffer for <hi>Chriſt,</hi> though with the Loſs of all; as having learned, that <hi>whoſoever will ſave his Life ſhall loſe it, and whoſoever will loſe his Life for Chriſt's ſake ſhall find it,</hi> Matth. 16.25. <hi>What things were gain to me,</hi> ſaith S. <hi>Paul,</hi> (<hi>Phil.</hi> 3.7, 8, 9, 10, 11.) <hi>thoſe I have counted Loſs for Chriſt. Yea doubtleſs, and I do count all things but Loſs, for the excellency of the Knowledge of Chriſt Jeſus our Lord, for whom I have ſuffered the Loſs of all things, and do count them but dung, that I may win Chriſt, and be found in him; that I may know him, and the power of his Reſurrection, and the fellowſhip of his Sufferings, being made conformable unto his Death; if by any means I might attain unto the Reſurrection of the dead.</hi> Which occaſions them to ſeek the Path of this Life, which is the next thing en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired into, and is now to be conſidered.</p>
               <p n="2">II. <hi>What is the Path, or what the Ways of this Life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Ways</hi> or <hi>Path of Life</hi> is a Metaphor taken from Travellers, who have a certain Track in which they are to tread, and by going in which they are guided to the place to which their Journey tends, and by its di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection are aſcertained of coming thither, if they hold on their Motion. Here in this paſſage it can be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for no other then the Means of aſſurance of their attaining this Life. Which in reſpect of <hi>Chriſt</hi> are,</p>
               <p n="1">1. On God's part, the Engagement of his Father to him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.10, 11. that <hi>when he ſhould make his Soul
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:42122:162"/>an Offering for Sin, he ſhould ſee his Seed, he ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long his days, and the pleaſure of the Lord ſhould proſper in his hand: He ſhould ſee of the travail of his Soul, and be ſatisfied. Chriſt</hi> undertook the great Buſineſs of <hi>do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Father's Will,</hi> which was <hi>written in the volume of his Book,</hi> by offering that <hi>Body</hi> which his Father <hi>had prepared him,</hi> upon a Contract between them when he came into the world; as it is deſcribed <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.5, 7, 8. And this was, that he ſhould ſo lay down his Life, as to take it up again; as <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf declareth, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.18. <hi>I have power to lay down my Life, and to take it up again: this Commandment have I received of my Father.</hi> Which thing made it <hi>impoſſible that he ſhould be holden of the pains of death,</hi> Act. 2.24. And therefore it is ſaid, <hi>He foreſaw the Lord always before his face,</hi> as being <hi>on his right hand, that he ſhould not be moved</hi> with the fear of Death, verſ. 25. being firmly aſſured by his Father's Covenant, (upon which he put himſelf on that great Expedition of Coming into the world to ſave Sinners, by the offering of himſelf,) that he ſhould not loſe by his Adventure, but ſhould after his Sufferings enter into his Glory. To which is to be adjoyned the Love that his Father bare to him for this reaſon, as he expreſſeth it <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.15, 17, 18. <hi>As the Father knoweth me, even ſo I know the Father; and I lay down my Life for the Sheep. Therefore doth my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther love me, becauſe I lay down my Life, that I might take it up again. No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of my ſelf.</hi> This unparallel'd Dutifulneſs of <hi>Chriſt</hi> to his Father, in yielding ſo freely to his Self-exinani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Humiliation unto Death, did obtain a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Love from his Father to him, and engage his Truth and Power to revive and ſuperexalt him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. On <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s part, his ready Obedience to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Will was the Path to Life: which therefore he
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:42122:162"/>allegeth in that Prayer of his wherein he opened his Boſome to his Father, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.4, 5. <hi>I have glorified thee on Earth, I have finiſhed the Work thou gaveſt me to doe: And now, O Father, glorifie thou me with thine own ſelf, with the Glory which I had with thee before the World was.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In reſpect of Believers, the Path of Life to them is,</p>
               <p n="1">1. On God's part, the free Love of God in chuſing them to Life; termed the <hi>writing their Names in the Book of Life from the foundation of the world,</hi> Rev. 17.8. which (becauſe they are given to <hi>Chriſt</hi>) is ſaid to be the <hi>Lamb's Book of life,</hi> Rev. 21.27. and our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our tells them, their <hi>names are written in Heaven,</hi> Luk. 10.20. Hereby is <hi>Chriſt</hi> engaged to <hi>give Life to them,</hi> as he himſelf teſtifieth, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.39. <hi>And this is the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's will which hath ſent me, that of all which he hath given me, I ſhould loſe nothing, but ſhould raiſe it up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain at the laſt day.</hi> And accordingly he ſaith, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.2. <hi>As thou haſt given him power over all fleſh, that he ſhould give eternall Life to as many as thou haſt given him.</hi> Hereby it is that <hi>Chriſt</hi> is become the Path of Life to them; as at ſeveral times he declares. <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.6. <hi>Jeſus ſaith unto Thomas, I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life: no man cometh to the Father but by me.</hi> Joh. 11.25. <hi>Jeſus ſaid unto Martha, I am the Reſurrection and the Life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And indeed <hi>Chriſt</hi> is the Way of Life,</p>
               <p n="1">1. As he is the Exemplary Cauſe of it. All <hi>whom</hi> his Father <hi>hath foreknown,</hi> being <hi>predeſtinated to be confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to the Image of his Son, that he might be the firſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born among many Brethren,</hi> Rom. 8.29. Wherefore <hi>Chriſt</hi> told his Diſciples, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.19. <hi>Becauſe I live, ye ſhall live alſo.</hi> The Life of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which he recovered by his Reſurrection, is the efficacious Pattern or Copy according to which God hath contrived our Life. He
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:42122:163"/>
                  <hi>is riſen from the dead, and become the firſt-fruits of them that ſleep. For ſince by Man came Death, by Man came alſo the Reſurrection of the dead. For as in Adam all die, even ſo in Chriſt ſhall all be made alive,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.20, 21, 22.</p>
               <p>Hence the Apoſtle tells us, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.3. that <hi>we are dead, and our Life is hid with Chriſt in God;</hi> it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſited as a Treaſure in <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s hand, who is the Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtee, to whom our Life is conveyed <hi>ad opus &amp; uſum noſtrum,</hi> for our uſe and behoof, (as the Lawyers uſe to ſpeak:) he hath Livery and Seiſin given of Life on our behalf, and ſo his Life is the Pledge and Path of our Life.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As <hi>Chriſt</hi> is the Way of our Life as he is our Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern, Depoſitary and Pledge; ſo is he the Way of our Life as the procuring Cauſe thereof: He is <hi>the Prince of Life,</hi> Act. 3.15. the Cauſe or <hi>Authour of eternall Salvation,</hi> Heb. 5.9. and that many ways.</p>
               <p>Firſt, by his Preaching: which moved S. <hi>Peter</hi> to ſay, <hi>Lord, to whom ſhall we go? thou haſt the words of eternall Life,</hi> Joh. 6.68. <hi>The words,</hi> ſaith <hi>Chriſt, that I ſpeak unto you, they are Spirit, and they are Life,</hi> verſ. 63. The Preaching of the Law was but <hi>the Miniſtration of Death, of the Letter, that killed,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6, 7. but the word of the Goſpel is <hi>the word of Life,</hi> Phil. 2.16.</p>
               <p>Secondly, by his Death: for ſo he tells us <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.51. <hi>I am the living Bread, which came down from Heaven: if any man eat of this Bread, he ſhall live for ever: and the Bread which I will give is my Fleſh, which I will give for the Life of the world.</hi> And indeed it was for this very cauſe, that, <hi>as the Children were partakers of fleſh and bloud, ſo he alſo took part of the ſame; that by Death he might deſtroy him that had the power of Death, to wit, the Devill; and deliver them that through fear of Death were all their Life ſubject to bondage,</hi> Heb. 2.14,
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:42122:163"/>15. <hi>As by the Offence of one, Judgment came upon all men to Condemnation: even ſo by the Righteouſneſs of one,</hi> (better rendred, <hi>by one Righteous deed,</hi> to wit, his Obedience unto Death,) <hi>the free Gift came upon all men unto Sanctification of life. That as Sin hath reigned un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Death; ſo might Grace reign through Righteouſneſs unto eternall Life, by Jeſus Chriſt our Lord,</hi> as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.18, 21. His Death procures our Life, both <hi>removendo Prohibens,</hi> by taking away <hi>the Sting of Death, Sin,</hi> diſarming Satan of his Power; and by me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritoriouſly purchaſing our Life, by paying a Price for us.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, by his Reſurrection, whereby he becomes as <hi>the Firſt-fruits,</hi> that ſanctifies the reſt of the <hi>Lump,</hi> and ſo obtains Reſurrection and Life for thoſe that are <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s. As alſo he is impowered to give Life upon his Reſurrection; as himſelf ſaith, <hi>All Power is given to me in Heaven and in Earth,</hi> Matth. 28.18. <hi>As the Father raiſeth up the dead, and quickeneth them; even ſo the Son quickeneth whom he will,</hi> Joh. 5.21. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Apoſtle argues thus, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.10. <hi>For if when we were Enemies, we were reconciled to God by the Death of his Son; much more being reconciled, we ſhall be ſaved by his Life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, by his Aſcenſion, whereby he is become <hi>an High Prieſt,</hi> not on Earth, but ſuch as <hi>is ſet down on the right hand of the Throne of the Majeſty in the Heavens,</hi> Heb. 8.1. He is not as the Prieſts of the Law, who <hi>were not ſuffered to continue by reaſon of death;</hi> but <hi>continueth for ever,</hi> and <hi>hath an unchangeable Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,</hi> or a Prieſthood that paſſeth not from one to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, being <hi>made, not after the Law of a carnal Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, but after the power of an endleſs</hi> or indiſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luble <hi>Life:</hi> and therefore <hi>he is able to ſave them to the uttermoſt,</hi> or evermore, <hi>that come unto God by him;
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:42122:164"/>ſeeing he ever liveth to make Interceſſion for them,</hi> Heb. 7.16, 23, 24, 25.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, He is <hi>the Prince of Life,</hi> or Cauſe of our Life, by ſhedding forth his Spirit after his being glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, which was as <hi>Rivers of living water,</hi> as his own words import, <hi>Joh.</hi> 7.38, 39. This Gift of the Spirit of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is that whereby we are born again to a Spiritual Life. <hi>That which is born of the Spirit is Spirit,</hi> ſaith <hi>Chriſt,</hi> Joh. 3.6. <hi>It is the Spirit that quickeneth, the Fleſh profiteth nothing,</hi> Joh. 6.63. Neither indeed had <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Preaching or his Dying availed to bring us to Life, had he not given us of his Spirit. And therefore herein was the Prerogative of the Goſpel above the Law, that whereas that gave the Command, but could not give the Spirit, being a dead Letter; by the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of the Spirit</hi> (or <hi>the Law of the Spirit of life, Rom.</hi> 8.2.) Chriſtians are <hi>made alive,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6. The Goſpel is become <hi>the Miniſtration of Righteouſneſs,</hi> verſ. 9. <hi>If Chriſt be in you, the body is dead, becauſe of Sin; but the Spirit is Life, becauſe of Righteouſneſs. But if the Spirit of him that raiſed up Chriſt from the dead dwell in you, he that raiſed up Chriſt from the dead ſhall alſo quicken your mortall bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you,</hi> Rom. 8.10, 11.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Appearing ſhall conſummate the Life of a Believer. Though he now be dead in Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance to the World, to their Rites, Practices, Hopes, Injoyments, and <hi>his Life is</hi> now onely <hi>hid with Chriſt in God;</hi> yet when <hi>Chriſt, who is his Life, ſhall appear, then ſhall he alſo appear with him in Glory:</hi> as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſpeaks moſt comfortably, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.3, 4.</p>
               <p n="2">2. On our part, the Path of Life is,</p>
               <p n="1">1. In our Union to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which is by Faith, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he is our Head, and we are his Members, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore partakers of his Life. <hi>I live,</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle,
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:42122:164"/>
                  <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20.) <hi>yet not I, but Chriſt liveth in me: and the Life that I now live in the fleſh, I live by the Faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himſelf for me. Joh.</hi> 11.25, 26. <hi>He that believeth on me, although he were dead, yet ſhall he live: and whoſoever liveth, and believeth in me, ſhall never die.</hi> The Life of a Chriſtian is conjoyned with <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s, as that of a Child with the Mother's.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In our Conformity to <hi>Chriſt:</hi> 1. In Dying with him, and that, Firſt, to the World. <hi>If ye be dead with Chriſt from the Rudiments of the World, why, as though living in the world, are ye ſubject to Ordinances?</hi> Col. 2.20. <hi>God forbid that I ſhould glory ſave in the Croſs of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, whereby the World is crucified to me, and I unto the World,</hi> Gal. 6.14. Secondly, to Sin. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.6, 7, 8. <hi>Knowing this, that our Old man is cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified with him, that the body of Sin might be deſtroyed, that henceforth we ſhould not ſerve Sin. For he that is dead is freed from Sin. Now if we be dead with Chriſt, we believe that we ſhall live with him.</hi> Thirdly, by Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering with him. <hi>It is a faithfull ſaying, If we be dead with him, we ſhall alſo live with him; if we ſuffer, we ſhall alſo reign with him,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.11, 12. <hi>If ſo be we ſuffer with him, that we may be alſo glorified together, Rom.</hi> 8.17. 2. In his Reſurrection: and that, Firſt, by walking in Newneſs of Life. <hi>Like as Chriſt was raiſed from the dead by the Glory of his Father; even ſo we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſhould walk in Newneſs of Life;</hi> and thereby be <hi>plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted together in the likeneſs of his Reſurrection,</hi> Rom. 6.4, 5. Secondly, by living to God. As <hi>Chriſt, in that he liveth, liveth unto God:</hi> ſo thoſe that have <hi>put on Chriſt, reckon themſelves to be dead indeed unto Sin, but alive unto God through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord: they yield themſelves to God, as thoſe that are alive from the dead; and their Members as inſtruments of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:42122:165"/>unto God,</hi> Rom. 6.10, 11, 13. Thirdly, in ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the things above as their Treaſure: as the Apoſtle inferrs, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.1, 2. <hi>If ye be riſen with Chriſt, ſeek thoſe things which are above, where Chriſt ſitteth at the right hand of God. Set your Affections on things above, not on things on the Earth.</hi> I have inſiſted the longer on this Point, (of the Path of Life,) becauſe it is the main thing that concerns us to know.</p>
               <p n="3">III. <hi>How God makes known</hi> or <hi>ſhews this Path of Life to them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Queſtion is not hard to be reſolved from that which hath been already ſaid. God ſhewed <hi>Chriſt</hi> the Path of Life, 1. By his Promiſe to him, mentioned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, at his coming into the world: 2. By his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; he make it known experimentally to him, when he <hi>was raiſed from the dead by the Glory of the Father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To us he makes known the Ways of Life, 1. By his Son's <hi>Appearing,</hi> and his Goſpel, <hi>who hath aboliſhed Death, and hath brought Life and Immortality to life, through the Goſpell,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.10. 2. By his Spirit which he gives, whereby we are aſſured, that <hi>through</hi> it, <hi>mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying the deeds of the Body, we ſhall live,</hi> Rom. 8.13. <hi>We have received the Spirit which is of God, that we might know the things that are freely given us of God,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.12.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. <hi>Why God doth ſhew them this Path of Life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Reaſon of God's making known the Way of Life to <hi>Chriſt</hi> and to us is one and the ſame; That as thereby <hi>Chriſt</hi> was to be ſtrengthened in all his Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, in all his Sufferings, animated in all his Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to his Father's Will, by having an eye to the Life which was propounded to him: ſo ſhould all the Diſciples of <hi>Chriſt</hi> be confirmed in all their Sufferings, encouraged in all their Actings for <hi>Chriſt,</hi> by their Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance

               <p>I may ſay now with <hi>Moſes,</hi> Deut. 30.15, 19. <hi>See, I have ſet before you this day Life and Good, Death and Evill. Chuſe therefore Life,</hi> and <hi>take hold of the Paths of it.</hi> Life is a thing naturally deſired. It is true, in extreme Anguiſh, men <hi>chuſe Strangling rather then Life.</hi> In his Fits of ſore Pain, <hi>Job</hi> was in ſuch a mood, as to deſire Death moſt earneſtly, and to abhor Life. Yet ſimply, every living thing would fain live, it ſtruggles and ſtrives what it can to keep Life: men ſpare no coſt to continue it, though it be but for a while, and that not without a mixture of Sorrow and Trouble, to which the beſt Life on Earth is obnoxious. <hi>Life,</hi> we ſay, <hi>is ſweet:</hi> nor is the Devil taken for a Liar in this, when he ſaith, <hi>Skin for Skin, and all that a man hath will he give for his Life,</hi> Job 2.4. But, alas! this Life is
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:42122:166"/>too much prized; and that is the reaſon why a greater Death is conſequent upon the immoderate affecting of it: becauſe they would ſtill live here, many die for ever in Hell.</p>
               <p>That Life, the Way of which was ſhewed to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and now to you, is indeed worthy your knowing, worthy your embracing and purſuing. It is a holy Life, a happy Life, a ſafe Life, an eternall Life. If you live in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> you ſhall live with <hi>Chriſt:</hi> if you live in the Spirit, you ſhall be <hi>quickened by the Spirit:</hi> if you live <hi>the Life of God,</hi> you ſhall live in his Preſence. In a word, if you walk in the Paths of Life, which I have this day ſhewed you, you ſhall live, not the Life of Men onely, but of holy Angels; you ſhall live a Life as far beyond the Life of Kings, as Heaven is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Earth. The Life of the beſt and happieſt Kings hath been attended with much Care and many Dangers: nor is any Prince's Life-time ſo ſplendid, but that the Day is ſometimes darkened over him, and Storms beat on him, and perhaps his Sun ſets in a Cloud. 'Tis otherwiſe to be conceived of this Life; when once attained, it is never darkened, never eclip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, never ended.</p>
               <p>Oh that you would then learn to die with <hi>Chriſt,</hi> to Sin, to the World; to <hi>live by the Faith of the Son of God;</hi> to be conformed to him, by putting on <hi>the ſame mind that was in Chriſt;</hi> to live to God; to <hi>doe,</hi> not your own will, but <hi>the will of your Father which is in Heaven;</hi> to <hi>commit your Souls in well-doing,</hi> when you <hi>ſuffer</hi> for him, <hi>as to a faithfull Creatour.</hi> Is the Loſs of Credit, Goods, Peace, Liberty, Life, terrible to you? Why, the Life propounded to you will ſweeten all. Death it ſelf (though <hi>the King of Terrours</hi>) is to them that are in <hi>Chriſt</hi> as a Serpent without a Sting, which you may handle without Danger, without Fear:
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:42122:166"/>it will but (as the Poets feign of <hi>Medea</hi>'s Medicaments) let out your old Bloud, and beget new Life.</p>
               <p>When I conſider the voluptuous and worldly Life of moſt, it pities me to think, that Men, made to live like Angels, ſhould chuſe to live <hi>more Pecudum,</hi> a Life not higher then the Life of Beaſts: that thoſe who are made for God, for <hi>Chriſt,</hi> for Heaven, to live there, ſhould terminate their Thoughts, Affections, Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, on things on Earth, on Money, gay Cloathing, Mirth, Riot, Pomp, State, Favour of men, Vain-glory, and ſuch like momentany things, which muſt paſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and likely lead men to Hell, and end in a Life with Devils.</p>
               <p>Oh follow <hi>Chriſt,</hi> I beſeech you. If you value your Souls, caſt them not away on Trifles. Learn the Path that <hi>Chriſt</hi> choſe to Life: follow him, and you ſhall live with him. Let, I beſeech you, the ſerious War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> Matth. 7.13, 14. take impreſſion on you: <hi>Enter ye in at the ſtreight Gate; for wide is the Gate, and broad is the Way that leadeth to Deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and many there be which goe in thereat. But ſtreight is the Gate, and narrow is the Way which leadeth unto Life, and few there be that find it.</hi> Let your drowzy ſpirits heed S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s monitory Alarm, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.14. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake, thou that ſleepeſt, and ariſe from the dead, and Chriſt ſhall give thee Life.</hi> Amen.</p>

            <p>THIS Pſalm is a <hi>Golden Pſalm of David,</hi> and the words which I have read to you make the Cloſe of it: which whether they are meant of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or of <hi>David,</hi> or both, and ſo are applicable to <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his Members, hath been formerly conſidered. In reference to both the Firſt Propoſition in them hath been already handled; and therein the Encouragement which <hi>Chriſt</hi> had, and all Believers have, in their Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, by God's <hi>ſhewing them the way of Life,</hi> hath (though much ſhort of what ſo precious an Argument deſerved) been ſomewhat unfolded to you.</p>
            <p>That which is yet farther to be inſiſted on, is the latter part of the Verſe: in which, I told you, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained two more Obſervations.</p>
            <pb n="326" facs="tcp:42122:168"/>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>That in God's Preſence there is Fulneſs of Joy,</hi> or, <hi>Satiety of Joys before his Face, to Chriſt and all Believers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>That at his right hand they ſhall have Pleaſures for evermore,</hi> or, <hi>Pleaſures at his right hand to perpetuity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This latter S. <hi>Peter</hi> omits in his Citation of this Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.25, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yet it is not improbable but he alludes to it verſ. 33. where he uſeth theſe words, <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore being by the right hand of God exalted:</hi> and that the Holy Ghoſt intended it for a Prediction of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Aſcenſion and Sitting at the right hand of God; and ſo it is applicable both to <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Exaltation, and our <hi>ſitting together with Chriſt in heavenly places;</hi> of which S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.6.</p>
            <p>But the former is expreſly mentioned, with ſome lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle difference in the Reading, <hi>Thou ſhalt fill, repleniſh</hi> or <hi>make me full of Joy,</hi> or <hi>Gladneſs, with thy Countenance, Face,</hi> or <hi>Preſence.</hi> And it is alleged, as being the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial that ſtrengthned and reſtored the Spirits of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in his Agony at his Death; which is intimated in that ſpeech of the Authour to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> (12.2.) <hi>Loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king unto Jeſus, the Authour and Finiſher of our Faith, who for the joy that was ſet before him endured the Croſs, deſpiſing the Shame, and is ſet down at the right hand of the Throne of God:</hi> which ſhews, that both in the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and on the Croſs our Saviour had his Eye on <hi>the Joy that was ſet before him,</hi> as the Prop and Baſis that did ſupport him in thoſe extreme Paſſions and heavy Burthens, which no other Shoulders but his could bear, ſo as not to ſink under their preſſure. And S. <hi>Peter</hi> tells us, (1 Epiſt. 1.11.) That <hi>the Prophets ſearched what or what manner of time the Spirit of Chriſt which was in them did ſignifie, when it teſtified before-hand the Sufferings of Chriſt, and the Glory that ſhould follow,</hi> or <hi>the Glories after them.</hi> Which ſhews that the Prophets did teſtifie before-hand, together with the Sufferings of
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:42122:168"/>
               <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the Glories after them: which no doubt was done in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22. and in many other places: of which number I queſtion not but theſe words of my Text are, by S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s alleging them <hi>Act.</hi> 2.28.</p>

                  <hi>That there are Joys in God's Preſence,</hi> or, <hi>with his Face,</hi> or <hi>Countenance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſame is in other words taught us <hi>Pſal.</hi> 36.9. <hi>For with thee is the Fountain of Life: in thy Light</hi> (that is, in the Light of thy Countenance) <hi>we ſhall ſee Light,</hi> that is, Joy and Gladneſs; according as it is explicated <hi>Pſal.</hi> 97.11. <hi>Light is ſown for the Righteous, and Gladneſs for the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pright in heart.</hi> To like purpoſe is that paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage <hi>Pſal.</hi> 30.5. <hi>In his Favour is Life: Weeping may endure for a night,</hi> or <hi>in the evening; but Joy cometh in the morning.</hi> Though in the Night-time or Evening, when the black Veil of Death covers their Faces, there is Sadneſs and Weeping even to the Righteous; yet Joy comes in the Morning of the Reſurrection, when
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:42122:169"/>
                  <hi>the Sun of Righteouſneſs ſhall appear with Healing in his wings,</hi> Mal. 4.2. and they ſhall ſee the Face of God.</p>
               <p>The better to conceive this, we muſt conſider, 1. What <hi>Joy</hi> is: 2. What Joys are <hi>in the Preſence of God:</hi> 3. And from what Cauſe or Motive they come.</p>
               <p n="1">I. <hi>What Joy is.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Joy is that Affection of the Soul, whereby it embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth ſome preſent or future Good. For there is a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing in Hope,</hi> (as the Apoſtle ſpeaks <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.12.) <hi>Abraham rejoyced to ſee Chriſt's day; and he ſaw it, and was glad,</hi> Joh. 8.56. Now of all Affections this is the ſweeteſt to a man's ſelf, as Love is the ſweeteſt to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Joy is that which chears the Spirits, enlargeth the Heart, which is ſhrivell'd up and contracted, like a Purſe, by Grief and Fear. It makes the Countenance lightſome, the Feet and other Members lively and nimble; furthers the Concoction of our Meat, makes our Sleep, which refreſheth the body, ſweet to us. And therefore Joy is moſt ſutable to the Will of man, and, if the Mind be in its right wits, is always deſired.</p>
               <p>Now Joys are of ſeveral ſorts, according to the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of the Objects, Motives and Means of Rejoycing. There are Objects of Joy within us, and without us; matters carnal or ſpiritual, temporal or eternal, preſent or future; from faith or ſight, hoping or feeling; na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, and acquired; longer or ſhorter in duration: which make our Joys either more pure or mixed, grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or leſſer, with great difference in degrees upon va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riation of Circumſtances, different apprehenſions of the Object, and the Good that accrues by it; either comparatively with the precedent Evil felt or feared, or abſolutely, as the thing is good in it ſelf and its own nature, or in reſpect of our Intereſt in it good to us.</p>
               <p>Should I here make a Philoſophical diſcourſe of this Affection, and exhibit to you a Scheme of the ſeveral
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:42122:169"/>kinds, degrees, properties and effects of this one Affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I might ſpend more then an hour upon this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. But I paſs to the next Head.</p>
               <p n="2">II. <hi>What Joys are in the Preſence of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thoſe Joys are the beſt which ſpring from the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing of the beſt and moſt laſting Good, with leaſt Defectiveneſs, and greateſt Latitude. And ſuch are the Joys that are in the Preſence of God, or, with his Face and Countenance. For therein there is, 1. a perfect Freedom from all Evil; 2. an entire Enjoyment of all Good in its Purity and Reſplendency.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Evils a man is delivered from do much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haunſe his Joys. He that is delivered from Dangers and Fears doth rejoyce: and the Joy is the more, if the Dangers were great and apparent, the Fears of Evil im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent and oppreſſing; ſtill more, when the Evils have been felt, and that with much Anguiſh and long Continuance. How do men rejoyce, when they have overthrown their Adverſary in a Law-ſuit, in which if they had been caſt, they had been undone in their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates? How do men rejoyce, when they have over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come their Enemies in Battel, to whom if they had been Captives, they had been led into Exile from their own Country? How do Slaves rejoyce, when they are redeemed from <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Bondage, and, in ſtead of row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in their Gallies, are returned to live with their own Maſters in their own Families? How do Priſoners con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to the Gallows rejoyce, when the King ſends them a Pardon, and they eſcape the hands of the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioner?</p>
               <p>Theſe Deliverances do cauſe much Joy and Exulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in men, and ſometimes much Glorying; though perhaps they be not long free from the Fear and Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of their Evils, but, in the Change of Fortune, fall into the ſame or greater Miſchieſs: or if they eſcape
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:42122:170"/>them, yet their Victory, Pardon, or Redemption, though it bring them Liberty, perhaps reduces them to Pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and a low eſtate. And, which is worſt, although they overcome their Adverſary on Earth, yet the Devil their Adverſary prevails againſt them; though they get the Victory againſt their other Enemies, yet they are led captive by their own <hi>Luſts which ſight againſt their Souls;</hi> though they be without Wounds by a Sword in their Bodies, yet they have ſore Wounds in their Conſciences by their Sins; though they be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned by the King, yet they are condemned by the King of Kings; though they are redeemed from <hi>Turks,</hi> yet not from Hell. And ſure a Holy heart that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpers in the one, and not in the other, finds his Joys damped ſo, as that he can ſcarce think thoſe Deliveran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces worth the rejoycing in.</p>
               <p>A Holy heart rejoyceth indeed with hearty Joy, when he prevails againſt his Adverſary the Devil and his Temptations; when he is cured of the Wounds of his Spirit; when he hath gotten power over that <hi>Body of death</hi> that makes him cry out, <hi>O wretched man that I am! who ſhall deliver me from</hi> it? They are the Deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of God, the Domineering of his Corruption, the Abſence of God's Spirit, his Decay in Prayer, his Doubts of his Intereſt in God's Grace, his Backſlidings, Inconſtancy in good, and ſuch like Spiritual Evils, that do moſt annoy him, eclipſe his Joys, beget in him Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothymies, Fainting fits, cold Sweats, Trembling of Heart, Fearfulneſs and Dejection of Spirit. Theſe break his Bones, envenome his Spirits, make him loathſome to himſelf, as a man whoſe <hi>Wounds ſtink and are cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt.</hi> And therefore there is no Joy to ſuch an one, till he have <hi>the Joy of Salvation</hi> from God; till <hi>in the multitude of the thoughts</hi> of his Heart, <hi>the Comforts of God refreſh his Soul;</hi> till he finds the Preſence of God
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:42122:170"/>accepting him; till he ſfinds that God prepares his Heart to Prayer, and then inclines his Ear to hear; till God ſpeaks Peace to him, ſprinkles the Bloud of <hi>Chriſt</hi> on his Conſcience, and frees him from his Fear of God's Wrath and Condemnation; till <hi>there be a Meſſenger, an Interpreter, one among a thouſand, to ſhew unto him his Righteouſneſs;</hi> till God <hi>be gracious unto him, and ſaith, Deliver him from going down to the Pit, I have found a ranſome;</hi> till <hi>he pray unto God, and he be favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable unto him, and he ſee his Face with Joy:</hi> as <hi>Elihu</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Job</hi> 33.23, 24, 26. He is not till then free from Anguiſh of Spirit and Anxiety of Soul.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In the day of my Trouble,</hi> ſaith <hi>Aſaph,</hi> (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 77.2, 3, 7, 8, 9.) <hi>I ſought the Lord: my Sore ran in the night, and ceaſed not; my Soul refuſed to be comforted. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred God, and was troubled: I complained, and my Spirit was overwhelmed. Will the Lord caſt off for ever? and will he be favourable no more? Is his Mercy clean gone for ever? doth his Promiſe fail for evermore? Hath God forgotten to be gracious? hath he in anger ſhut up his tender Mercies?</hi> Thus mournfully alſo ſpeaks <hi>Heman</hi> the <hi>Ezrahite,</hi> Pſal. 88.3, 6, 7. <hi>My Soul is full of Troubles, and my life draweth nigh unto the Grave. Thou haſt laid me in the loweſt Pit, in darkneſs, in the deeps. Thy Wrath lieth hard upon me, and thou haſt afflicted me with all thy waves.</hi> And then expoſtulates, verſ. 14, <hi>&amp;c. Lord, why caſteſt thou off my Soul? why hideſt thou thy face from me? I am afflicted, and ready to die: while I ſuffer thy Terrours, I am diſtracted. Thy fierce Wrath goeth over me, thy Terrours have cut me off. They come round about me daily like water, they compaſſed me about together.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Such Complaints are frequent in the <hi>Pſalms, Job,</hi> and <hi>Hezekiah</hi>'s Song. In the Penitentials of Holy men, (in the <hi>Relation of the Lives of Godly perſons of tender
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:42122:171"/>Conſciences, Men and Women, of former and later days,</hi>) we meet with ſuch Apprehenſions of their Sins, dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of Temptations, want of God's Spirit, hiding of his Face, as benight their Souls, take away their Joys, fill them with Penſiveneſs, Horrour, and Fear of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Vengeance, of Hell-ſire, of Apparitions of Devils, that they can neither feed pleaſantly in the day, nor reſt quietly in the night, but look ghaſtly with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected Countenances, and <hi>goe mourning,</hi> in the <hi>bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their Spirit,</hi> all their days.</p>
               <p>But when theſe Clouds are ſeattered, this Darkneſs taken away, ſo as that they can ſay with that Martyr, <hi>He is come, He is come;</hi> [<hi>Glover,</hi> in Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s days, burnt at <hi>Coventry;</hi>] when they can diſcern the Light of God's Countenance ſhining upon them, can ſee him reconciled in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> can hear the voice of <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to them, <hi>Son, be of good chear, thy Sins are forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven thee;</hi> when they find the Spirit enabling them to pour out their Souls before the Lord; when their Souls can ſend this Challenge to the Gates of Hell, <hi>Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of God's Elect? it is God that juſtifieth. Who ſhall condemn? it is Chriſt that died, or rather is riſen again, who alſo ſitteth at the right hand of God, making Interceſſion for us. Who ſhall ſeparate us from the Love of God?</hi> Then there is rejoycing indeed, then they <hi>rejoyce with Joy unſpeakable and full of glory,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.8. Though they be in much Affliction, they can ſing in the Fire, and clap their hands at the Stake; in a poor Cottage, in a Priſon, they can be as merry as if they were in a ſtately Palace: for then they are delivered from their greateſt Enemies, and their greateſt Fears.</p>
               <p>Now the Joys that are in the Preſence of God are for Deliverance from theſe Evils, from all of them, bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily and ſpiritual; from unrighteous Sentences of men,
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:42122:171"/>violent Captivity, forcible reſtraint of Liberty, Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Loſſes, Sorrows, Death; and, which is more, from all Corruptions within, Temptations to Sin from without, from the Malice of men, the Power of Satan, the Hiding of God's Countenance, the Abſence of his Spirit, the Fear of Hell. They that are with God, in his Preſence, doe as the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> did, when they ſaw the <hi>Egyptians</hi> dead on the Sea-ſhore, they triumphantly glory in their Deliverance: <hi>they ſing as it were a new Song before the Throne: they ſing the Song of Moſes and of the Lamb, with the Harps of God, ſaying, Great and marvellous are thy works, Lord God Almighty; juſt and true are thy Ways, thou King of Saints,</hi> Rev. 15. v. 3. There they, with the greateſt glorying and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimity of Spirit, take up the ſpeech of the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.55, 56, 57. <hi>O Death, where is thy Sting? O Grave, where is thy Victory? The Sting of Death is Sin, and the Strength of Sin is the Law. But thanks be to God, that giveth us the Victory, through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The Joys that Believers have in God's Preſence are not onely becauſe of Freedom from all the Evils which in their life-time did annoy them, but alſo by reaſon of the entire injoyment of all Good in its Purity and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſplendency. Many things there are which men rejoyce in on Earth: and if but in one ſingle Excellency they find themſelves goe beyond others, how do they glory in it, as if others were not to be named the ſame day with them? Some rejoyce in their Deſcent and Paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage; as <hi>Pharaoh, I am the ſon of the wiſe, the ſon of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Kings,</hi> Iſa. 19.11. Some in their Beauty; as <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalom,</hi> that gloried in his unblemiſhed Body and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Head of hair. Some in their Wiſedom and Skill, their Riches and Proſperity; as the King of <hi>Tyrus,</hi> that had his <hi>Heart lifted up, and ſaid, I am a God, I ſit in
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:42122:172"/>the Seat of God, in the midſt of the Seas. Behold, thou art wiſer then Daniel; there is no Secret that they can hide from thee. With thy Wiſedom and with thy <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding thou haſt gotten thee Riches, and haſt gotten Gold and Silver into thy Treaſures; and thine Heart is lifted up becauſe of thy Riches,</hi> Ezek. 28.2, 3, 4, 5. Some in their Honours; as <hi>Haman</hi> did in King <hi>Ahaſuerus</hi> his <hi>promoting him,</hi> Eſther 5.11. Some in their Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; as the <hi>Phariſee</hi> that boaſted he <hi>was not as other men are, nor as the Publican,</hi> Luk. 18.11. Yea, ſome can rejoyce in their unſociable, Cynical, ſowr, auſtere Deportment, though it be but a Deluſion, if they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Holineſs in it; as Monks, Anchorets, Quakers, and ſuch like, have done, and doe at this day.</p>
               <p>All theſe, and many more things, the Hearts of men can rejoyce in, though they be ſome of them but vain things, ſome but petty good things; yea, if they were enjoyed in their Confluence, as <hi>Solomon</hi> enjoyed them, (who had Wealth, and Wiſedom, and Beauty, and Dominion, and what-ever the carnal Heart of man af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects; and yet, after his ample experience of the Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of them, gives this account of them, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 1.2. <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Vanities, all is Vanity, yea Vexation of Spirit</hi>) they produce but a forced Mirth, <hi>Sardonium Riſum,</hi> notwithſtanding which, <hi>in the midſt of Laughter the Heart is ſorrowfull, and the end of their Mirth is Heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> As it was with <hi>Belſhazzar,</hi> Dan. 5.6. He was in his Royall Palace at <hi>Babylon,</hi> carouſing in gold and ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, with his Wives and Concubines, praiſing his Gods; when on a ſudden, upon a Hand's writing on the Wall, <hi>the King's Countenance was changed, and his Thoughts troubled him ſo, that the Joynts of his Loins were looſed, and his Knees ſmote one againſt another.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That which is worth rejoycing at indeed, as beget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a permanent and genuine Joy, ſutable to the Spirit
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:42122:172"/>of a man, is his Acquaintance with God, his Knowledge of him, God's Adopting him to an Inheritance with him, his Relation to the Son of God, the Habitation of his Bleſſed Spirit in him, the Holineſs of his Heart, the Beauty that is in <hi>the hidden man of the Heart, which is in the ſight of God of great Price;</hi> the hearing of his Prayers, the accepting of his Works, the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of his God, the Love of his Saviour. In theſe things are the Joys of the Saints. So ſaith S. <hi>Paul, We are they that rejoyce in Chriſt Jeſus, and have no confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the fleſh,</hi> Phil. 3.3. <hi>God forbid that I ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce</hi> in any thing <hi>ſave in the Croſs of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, whereby the World is crucified unto me, and I unto the World,</hi> ſaith the ſame S. <hi>Paul,</hi> Gal. 6.14. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny there be that ſay, Who will ſhew us any Good? Lord, lift thou up the light of thy Countenance upon us. Thou haſt put Gladneſs in my heart, more then in the time that their Corn and their Wine increaſed,</hi> ſaith <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 4.6, 7. And again, <hi>I have rejoyced in the way of thy Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies, as much as in all Riches,</hi> Pſal. 119.14. Theſe things do indeed beget the moſt ſolid Joys, which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten the Eyes, and chear the Heart under many Wants, many Dangers, many Perſecutions, many Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations of future Evils.</p>
               <p>And yet theſe Joys are eclipſed to the moſt Holy man. Sometimes by his own Sins, and the Withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God's Spirit from him; as the caſe was with <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid.</hi> Sometimes by reaſon of Calamities, and the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Practices of his Children; as it was alſo with him. Sometimes from his Doubting of his own ſpiritual E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, from the want of ſuch Feeling as once he had of the Efficacy of God's Grace in his Heart, by the Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of it to holy Exerciſes, to Prayer, Praiſing God, and heavenly Meditations; in the quieting of his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, by remembrance of God's Covenant of Grace in
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:42122:173"/>
                  <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the Love of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in giving himſelf for him; in the aſſurance of his Perſeverance to the end, and the knowledge of his Integrity. Yea, Holy perſons do of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten <hi>go mourning</hi> all their days, charging themſelves with Hypocriſie, with Blaſphemy againſt the Holy Ghoſt, with Apoſtaſie, condemning themſelves as Reprobates, uncapable of Pardon, deſtitute of all Grace, and ſo no better then Fire-brands of Hell; and this even while they pray for Pardon, repent of Sin, are of ſo tender Conſciences, that they fear to ſin againſt God, and would rather die a thouſand Deaths then once ſpeak the leaſt evil of <hi>Chriſt</hi> or God.</p>
               <p>If none of theſe Clouds do darken the Joys of Holy men here; yet there are other things which do, and will certainly, while they are on Earth, much dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh them. The Sins which they ſee committed by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are no ſmall Vexation to Holy men. <hi>Juſt Lot</hi> was <hi>vexed with the filthy Converſation of the Wicked:</hi> for, <hi>dwelling among the Sodomites, in hearing and ſeeing,</hi> he <hi>tormented his righteous Soul from day to day with their unlawfull deeds,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.7, 8. The Sufferings of the Saints are no ſmall Affliction to their Fellow-members. <hi>If one Member ſuffer, all the Members ſuffer with it;</hi> as <hi>if one Member be honoured, all the Members rejoyce with it,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.26. Much more are their Sins. The ince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtuous <hi>Corinthian</hi>'s ſinfull taking his Father's Wife, was matter of Mourning to the whole Church. So the Schiſms in that Church, the Diſorders in their Aſſemblies, their Yielding to communicate with Idolaters in their Idolatries, their going to Law one with another before Infidels, and not compoſing their Differences between themſelves, were matter of Affliction to S. <hi>Paul. I fear,</hi> ſaith he, (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.20, 21.) <hi>leſt when I come, I ſhall not find you ſuch as I would; leſt my God will humble me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you,</hi> and <hi>that I ſhall bewail many which have ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:42122:173"/>already, and have not repented of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncleanneſs and Fornication and Laſciviouſneſs which they have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Ignorance, Unteachableneſs, Unfruitfulneſs of his Hearers, much more their falling away into Errours and ſcandalous Practices, is no ſmall Grief to a Godly Paſtour; which makes him walk heavily, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain to God, <hi>ſerving him with many Tears and Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yea, the <hi>deferring</hi> of a Chriſtian's <hi>Hope makes his Heart ſick;</hi> he is weary with waiting, ſo that he cries, <hi>Come, Lord Jeſus, come quickly. Our ſelves, which have the Firſt-fruits of the Spirit, even we our ſelves groan within our ſelves, waiting for the Adoption, to wit, the Redemption of our bodies,</hi> Rom. 8.23. <hi>In this we groan earneſtly, deſiring to be cloathed upon with our houſe which is from Heaven. For we that are in this Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle do groan, being burthened; not for that we would be uncloathed, but cloathed upon, that Mortality might be ſwallowed up of Life.</hi> Being <hi>confident, and willing ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be abſent from the Body, and to be preſent with the Lord,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.2, 4, 8.</p>
               <p>But they that are in the Preſence of God have all Good. They have the moſt high Deſcent, as being <hi>born of God:</hi> the moſt perfect Beauty in Soul, having the Image of God perfectly reſtored; and at the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection their <hi>Bodies faſhioned like unto the glorious Body of Chriſt.</hi> They become fully Rich, being made <hi>Heirs of God, Joynt-heirs with Chriſt,</hi> Rom. 8.17. When they <hi>have overcome, they ſhall inherit all things: God will be their God, and they ſhall be his Sons,</hi> Rev. 21.7. They have advancement to Honour and Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. <hi>To him that overcometh,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, (Rev. 3.21.) <hi>will I grant to ſit with me in my Throne; even as I alſo overcame, and am ſet down with my Father in his Throne.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="338" facs="tcp:42122:174"/>
               <p>I will not ſay that the Bleſſed Saints and Angels that ſtand in God's Preſence are omniſcient: They know not the Secrets of Mens hearts, much leſs the ſecret Counſels of God, <hi>whoſe Ways are unſearchable, and whoſe Paths paſt finding out.</hi> That Conceit of ſome of the Papiſts, about the <hi>(Speculum Trinitatis,)</hi> the Glaſs of the Trinity, as if by ſeeing God, they could ſee all things in him, (according to that ſaying of <hi>Gregory, Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>det omnia qui videt Videntem omnia,</hi>) is moſt falſe: though ſome of them make uſe of it, to excuſe their abominable Invocation of Saints deceaſed, whom they abſurdly and fooliſhly pray to for all ſorts of Good things, though they know neither them nor their Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities, much leſs their Hearts. But I may ſafely ſay with the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.9, 10, 12. Now <hi>we know in part, and we propheſie in part. But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part ſhall be done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. Now we ſee through a Glaſs</hi> darkly, or <hi>in a Riddle; but then face to face: now I know in part; then ſhall I know even as alſo I am known.</hi> The Beatifical Viſion of God will perfect our Holineſs and Wiſedom ſo far, as to free us from all Errour and Folly, which now do mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerably miſlead us; from all Ignorance, which now doth ſadly perplex us: it will enlighten us with that Knowledge, which will be ſufficient to glorifie our God, and ſatisfie our ſelves. As the Light of Heaven exceeds the Light of the Sun: ſo the Light of the Soul in thoſe that are with God exceeds all the Light that was in <hi>Adam</hi> by Creation; in <hi>Moſes,</hi> S. <hi>John,</hi> S. <hi>Paul,</hi> or any other of the moſt inlightned Saints on Earth, by Revelation.</p>
               <p>In a word, there is no kind of Good, which is meet for a created Being and an adopted Child of God to have, but it is conferred on thoſe Holy perſons that are in the Preſence of God; which makes their Joys
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:42122:174"/>unſpeakable and full of Glory. But they are ſtill more ſweetned from the conſideration of the Fountain whence they flow: which is next to be conſidered.</p>
               <p n="3">III. <hi>What is the Cauſe and Motive from whence theſe Good things, theſe Joys, do proceed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And that is the Love and Purpoſe of God, which is immutable. <hi>Ointment and Perfumes rejoyce the Heart: ſo doth the ſweetneſs of a man's Friend by hearty Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon,</hi> Prov. 27.9. The Love and hearty Welcome that a man meets with, makes the Feaſt the more pleaſant. <hi>Eat not thou the Bread of him that hath an evil Eye, neither deſire thou his dainty Meats. For as he thinketh in his heart, ſo is he: Eat and drink, ſaith he to thee; but his heart is not with thee. The Morſell which thou haſt eaten thou ſhalt vomit up, and loſe thy ſweet words,</hi> Prov. 23.6, 7, 8. Oftentimes men are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited to a great Feaſt, but it is not out of Love, but for ſome ſordid Ends, to engage them in ſomething which they will find cauſe after to repent of; it is not with True-heartedneſs: which makes many ſad at Feaſts, as fearing an After-reckoning. <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s Brethren, when they ſate at meat with him, <hi>marvelled one at another, Gen.</hi> 43.33. not well knowing whereto that Invitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on tended. When men believe they are welcome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, and that they are feaſted in Love, they feed hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily, and are merry, without any Check in themſelves, or fear of After-repentance. It is ſo with them that feaſt in Heaven; that are <hi>called to the Supper of the Lamb;</hi> that <hi>eat and drink in his Kingdom;</hi> that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of that <hi>Feaſt full of fat things, a Feaſt of wine on the lees, of fat things full of marrow, of wine on the lees well refined,</hi> Iſa. 25.6. that partake of the Delicacies of Heaven, of the Riches and coſtly Entertainment there: they know they are heartily welcome to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; that they are not invited as <hi>Eſther</hi> invited <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
                  <pb n="340" facs="tcp:42122:175"/>to her Banquet, to betray him, but that they are in God's Preſence out of the pureſt Love, out of the moſt ſincere Motive, their Faithfulneſs to him, their Sufferings for him; and to the moſt deſirable End, the mutual Solace and Content of each in other: God hath not any intent to make a farther Triall of them, as of <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradiſe; but to put an end to their Suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings and hard Service, that they may keep an everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting Sabbath with him in Glory.</p>
               <p>I have ſhewed you in ſome Adumbration <hi>thoſe things which Eye hath not ſeen, nor Ear heard, neither hath it entred into the Heart of man to conceive, even the things God hath prepared for them that love him,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.9.

                  <hi>That there is a Fulneſs in theſe Joys.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This might be demonſtrated by the Kinds of them, they being not onely bodily, but Spiritual; not mixt, but pure; not in a leſs, but a moſt intenſe degree; not for a ſhort time, but for ever.

               <p>I do but curſorily paſs over theſe Points, that I may make ſome Application to your uſe: and that ſhall be,</p>
               <p n="1">1. To refute the Cenſures of Carnal men, who <hi>count the Courſe</hi> of the Righteous <hi>to be Madneſs, and his End without Honour;</hi> and therefore <hi>have him in Deriſion, and as a Proverb of Reproach:</hi> as it was obſerved long agoe in the Book of <hi>Wiſedom,</hi> Chap. 5.3, 4. They can diſcern no Joys in the humble penitent Believers, either at preſent or for the future. They are no whit acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with <hi>the Joy of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> nor the Comforts of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> nor the <hi>Fulneſs of Joy</hi> that is <hi>in the Preſence of God:</hi> and for this cauſe imagine the mortified Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an to be but a melancholick man, that fooliſhly pines away himſelf, not injoying that Mirth and that Benefit of ſuch things as are allowed to the ſons of men. And therefore if they find a perſon to be of a <hi>wounded Spirit,</hi> of a troubled Conſcience; if through Weakneſs a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of a tender Conſcience be penſive, afflicted with the ſenſe of Sin, and perplexed in Spirit; they impute it to Religion, to hearing of Sermons, and performing other holy Duties: while they themſelves think there is nothing better then to be merry while they may; to <hi>eat and drink, for to morrow they ſhall die. Come on,</hi> ſay they, <hi>let us enjoy the good things that are preſent; and let us ſpeedily uſe the Creatures like as in youth. Let us fill our ſelves with coſtly Wine and Ointments: and let no Flower of the Spring paſs by us. Let us crown our
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:42122:176"/>ſelves with Roſe-buds before they be withered. Let none of us goe without his part of our Jollity; let us leave tokens of our Joyfulneſs in every place: for this is our Portion, and our Lot is this,</hi> Wiſed. 2.6, 7, 8, 9. <hi>Come ye, ſay they, I will fetch Wine, and we will fill our ſelves with ſtrong Drink; and to morrow ſhall be as this day, and much more abundant,</hi> Iſa. 56.12.</p>
               <p>But ſure, ſober Infidels have taken ſuch Speeches to be rather the Speeches of Brutes then of Men. Who can conceive that Man, that hath an immortal Spirit breathed into him from <hi>the Father of Spirits,</hi> ſhould have no higher Joys then ſenſual Delights? that he ſhould be ſatisfied with ſuch Contents as are onely from Sublunary things? If the Philoſophers knew that Vertue of it ſelf could give ſuch Tranquillity of mind, ſuch ample Content, as that they could diſcern the Joys of Senſualiſts to be but the Foolery of beſotted men; Chriſtians may diſcern that the Joys of Philoſophers, in their dim Light of Reaſon and Morall honeſty, together with their glorying in their Idols, could be but as Moon-light, compared to the Sun, and their Joys in <hi>Chriſt.</hi> In God's Favour and Preſence are the real Joys; though obſcured from the World by the mean Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon Earth of thoſe that poſſeſs them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Oh then, you who have heard what Joys there are in God, be perſuaded to quicken and comfort your ſelves by them. Let not the Scoffs or Cenſures of the profane Carnaliſt affright you from your Choice. Place your Hope in the purſuance of thoſe Joys that are Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, that are Heavenly. <hi>David, Moſes,</hi> S. <hi>Paul,</hi> and He who was the wiſeſt of men, (our Lord <hi>Chriſt,</hi>) ſligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all the Contents on Earth, and patiently under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>went all Afflictions, all the Reproaches and Perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of men, that they might attain the Fulneſs of Joys in God's Preſence. Surely, ſhould all your days on

            <p>WE have in this Pſalm (whether compoſed by, or for <hi>Aſaph</hi> to ſing) a Skirmiſh between the Fleſh and the Spirit, with the Victory of the Spirit, thereby ſtrengthened to ſtand for God, and to adhere to his Party. The Combat aroſe from the Quarrel that humane Reaſon had againſt Divine Providence, as either unequall, or impotent, in that the Wicked proſpered in the world, when the Godly as poor Abjects were depreſſed and trampled upon by the <hi>Nimrods</hi> of the Earth: As if this did argue, either that God was ignorant of humane Affairs, that he ſaw not through the thick Clouds; that (according to the <hi>Epicurean</hi> Fancy) he followed his Pleaſure in Heaven, and let things below run at randome, leaving them to Chance: or that he would not or could not remedy ſuch Irregularities, as fell out in the Government of this lower World.</p>
            <pb n="346" facs="tcp:42122:178"/>
            <p>To which the Spirit oppoſeth (after ſome Stagge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring) this Defence: That the Proſperity of the Wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked was but for a moment, an empty Bitter-ſweet, a fanſied Dream, a meer Vanity, ending in Terrours which ſuddenly and irreſiſtibly caſt them down, like a Hurricane, and ſo carry them away to Deſtruction and Conſumption. That, on the other ſide, the Godly are preſerved and guided to Glory. And thence is the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit's <hi>Io Paean,</hi> its triumphant Song, aſcribing Happineſs to men of pure Hearts, and expreſſing a Reſolution to hold faſt to God, as being well aſſured of Divine Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance and Advancement, (in the words read to you) <hi>Thou ſhalt guide me with thy Counſell, and afterwards re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive me to Glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In which words the Pſalmiſt expreſſeth the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his future Happineſs: as in the Verſe before he declares the Cauſe of his preſent Standing, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Storm of Temptation that was upon him; upon what Bottom he ſecures his Soul, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſuch Onſets and Perills of wandering out of his way to Bleſſedneſs. For attaining of which Felicity, he aſcribes nothing to a fanſied Light within him, or power of Free will; but to that ſpecial efficacious Grace, which is preventing and ſuſtaining, that <hi>worketh in</hi> God's people <hi>both to will and to doe of his good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,</hi> Phil. 2.13. His Tuition and his Guidance is the entire and onely Cauſe of a Saint's aſſured Beatitude. And this the Authour of the Pſalm doth acknowledge, whilſt he expreſſes the ſenſe he had of his own nearneſs to Ruine, (when, as it is verſ. 2. he found that, <hi>as for him, his Feet were almoſt gone, his Steps had well-nigh ſlipt</hi>) had not God <hi>been with him continually,</hi> and <hi>held him by the right hand, guided him with his Counſell, and led him to Glory.</hi> From whence theſe Obſervations offer themſelves.</p>

               <p>The like Speech we have in the New Teſtament, in that Sermon which was made by S. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> at <hi>Lyſtra,</hi> when, to take them off from their intention of ſacrificing to themſelves, they told them of the Evil of their doings, and of the pernicious Conſequence of their practices in ſacrificing to them that were but Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities; and how that God in times paſt ſuffered all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to walk in their own Ways.</p>
               <p>Which Paſſages do evince, that the reaſon why both <hi>Jews and Gentiles were under Sin, all the World were become guilty before God, all had ſinned, and came ſhort of the Glory of God,</hi> Rom. 3.9, 19, 23. were under Wrath and Condemnation, was becauſe they were left to their own Counſells.

And even as they did not like to retain God in their Knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to doe thoſe things which are not convenient,</hi> verſ. 26, 28. which brought upon them the Judgment of God. And to like purpoſe is that Prediction, (which is upon co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent reaſon conceived to be verified in the <hi>Roman</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtaſie) 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.10, 11, 12. <hi>Becauſe they received not the love of the Truth, that they might be ſaved; for this cauſe God ſhall ſend them ſtrong Deluſions, that they ſhould believe a Lie: That they all might be damned, who believed not the Truth, but had pleaſure in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi>

                  <hi>It is the Safety of God's Servants, that they are guided by his Counſell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is a twofold Counſell of God. The firſt is that Counſell by which he guides himſelf: of which the Apoſtle ſpeaketh <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.11. that God <hi>worketh all things after the Counſell of his own Will;</hi> and of which the Pſalmiſt ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 33.10, 11. that <hi>The Lord brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth the Counſell of the Heathen to nought; he maketh the Devices of the people of none effect: The Counſell of the Lord ſtandeth for ever; the Thoughts of his Heart to all generations.</hi> And this Counſell of God is oft times con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Man's, and clean different from Man's Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations. For though <hi>there are many Devices in man's heart; nevertheleſs the Counſell of the Lord that ſhall ſtand,</hi> Prov. 19.21.</p>
               <p>Hereby he aſſerts his own Singularity, Independen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and Sovereign Dominion: as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 46.9, 10. <hi>Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the former things of old, for I am God, and there is none elſe; I am God, and there is none like me, declaring the end from the beginning, and from ancient times the things that are not yet done, ſaying, My Counſell ſhall ſtand, and I will doe all my Pleaſure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is not that <hi>Counſell</hi> of God by which he <hi>guides</hi> his Servants <hi>to Glory;</hi> this being <hi>the Secret</hi> which <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs</hi> onely <hi>to the Lord.</hi> But it is <hi>the Thing revealed</hi> which <hi>belongs to us, that we may</hi> hear it and <hi>doe it;</hi> it is this <hi>Counſell</hi> of God whereby he <hi>guides</hi> his people, and <hi>brings</hi> them <hi>to Glory.</hi> And though it be true, that even this is a Secret in reſpect of the World, the Great things of God's Law are ſtrange things to them, the Myſtery of Godlineſs is ſo profound, ſo confeſſedly great, as that <hi>none of the Princes of the world knew it;</hi>
                  <pb n="350" facs="tcp:42122:180"/>yea, when it was in <hi>Chriſt</hi> opened, it was <hi>the hidden Wiſedom of God in a myſtery,</hi> containing ſuch things as <hi>Eye had not ſeen, nor Ear heard, nor had entred into the Heart of man to conceive, even the things which God hath prepared for them that love him:</hi> Yet it was ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by God before the world, to our Glory, and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed to</hi> his people <hi>by his Spirit,</hi> who <hi>have received, not the ſpirit of the world, but the Spirit which is of God, that they might know the things which are freely given them of God:</hi> as it is 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.12. This <hi>Secret of the Lord is with them that fear him, and he will ſhew them his Covenant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is not either an imaginary Light in every man, conceived by deluded <hi>Quakers</hi> as ſufficient to guide them to God: nor is it any peculiar Enthuſiaſm, ſuch as Fanatick ſpirits have been deceived by: nor any ſuch Dreams and Apparitions as Friers and Monks have themſelves been abuſed by, and miſs-led other perſons, in times of Ignorance: nor any ſuch vain Raptures or Conceits, as thoſe whereby men have been ſo lifted up, as to deſpiſe others as Pygmies in Knowledge in reſpect of themſelves, or to fanſie as if they were of God's Privy Councill. But the Counſell of God by which he guides his Servants is his Word, containing his Precepts, his Promiſes, and what-ever Revelations in Holy Scripture he hath delivered <hi>for our learning, that we through Patience and Comfort of the Scripture might have hope:</hi> eſpecially the word of the Truth of the Goſpell; ſuch as S. <hi>Paul</hi> meant, <hi>Act.</hi> 20.20, 21, 24, 26, 27. when he ſaid to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> that he <hi>kept nothing back that was profitable to them, but teſtified to Jews and Greeks Repentance towards God, and Faith towards our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the Goſpell of the Grace of God;</hi> ſo that he was <hi>pure from the bloud of all men,</hi> in that he <hi>had not ſhunned to declare unto them the whole

               <p>The Glory which the Pſalmiſt may here mean (eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if <hi>David</hi> were the Penner of this Pſalm) is not unlikely to be the Glory which he expected in being made King of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> it being probable that this Pſalm was compoſed in the time of his Perſecution under <hi>Saul,</hi> during which he complained that his Enemies did

                  <hi>live and were mighty, and they that hated him wrongfully were many in number,</hi> Pſal. 38.19. Yet no doubt he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo had an eye to the Glory which he expected after this Life. So <hi>Pſalm</hi> 17. having prayed to the Lord, (verſ. 14, 15.) to <hi>deliver his Soul from the Wicked, which were his Sword; from the men of this world, which had their portion in this Life, whoſe bellies</hi> God <hi>filled with his hid treaſures,</hi> ſo as that <hi>they were full of Children, and left the reſt of their Subſtance to their Babes:</hi> he declares his expectation to be of a higher kind, (verſ. 18.) <hi>As for me, I will behold thy face in Righteouſneſs; I ſhall be ſatisfied when I awake with thy likeneſs.</hi> And this the phraſe of <hi>receiving him to Glory,</hi> after his <hi>guiding him by his Counſell,</hi> doth moſt clearly intimate.</p>
               <p>And indeed this is the thing which is the grand Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of the Saints, That God will not fail to <hi>lead them in his Paths for his Name's ſake;</hi> and ſo to <hi>order their Steps in his Word,</hi> that <hi>no Iniquity get dominion over them:</hi> that the Spirit of God will ſo <hi>quicken them,</hi> as they may <hi>run the way of his Commandments:</hi> that he will enable them to live by Faith in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by preſerve them to his heavenly Kingdom.</p>
               <p>It is that <hi>exceeding and enduring weight of Glory</hi> which is wrought by <hi>Afflictions,</hi> and the Guidance of Divine Teachings and Providences, that cauſeth them to <hi>look, not at the things which may be ſeen,</hi> which are but <hi>temporall, but the things which are unſeen</hi> and <hi>eternall,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.17, 18.

               <p>For Application hereof; If the Apoſtle had cauſe to be thankfull for the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> becauſe of God's <hi>calling</hi> them <hi>to the obtaining of the Glory of our Lord Chriſt:</hi> much more hath each believing Chriſtian cauſe to be thankfull to God, to rejoyce and take Comfort in this ſo bleſſed a Condition, of God's <hi>Guidance by his Counſell,</hi> ſo as to <hi>bring him to Glory.</hi> And ſince the leaving a man to his own Counſell is the Forerunner of Perdition; how ought he to dread (as a direfull Omen of the moſt execrable Condition) the being given over to follow his own Counſell, to be carried away by his own Luſts, as being a certain ſign of God's Deſertion, and expoſing of him as a Prey to the Devill?</p>
               <p>Wherefore it highly concerns every one who deſires his own Salvation, to follow that Admonition <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.11. to <hi>ſerve the Lord with fear, and rejoyce with trembling;</hi> or, as it is <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.12. to <hi>work out his Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation with fear and trembling.</hi> When we conſider our own Ignorance in the Way which leads to eternall Life, our Folly and Unskilfulneſs in finding it out, our Negligence in inquiring after it, our Inadvertency to that Teaching and direction which might guide us in it; when we ponder the vanity of humane Reaſon, our Frailty and Eaſineſs in hearkening to Deceivers, the inceſſant Diligence and Vigilancy of the old Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent in perverting us, the impoſſibility of our attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to Salvation by our own Wiſedom and Strength, and the extreme perill of Erring ſo as to periſh eternal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if we have not God's Guidance: we ſhall ſee great cauſe to fear our ſelves, find great reaſon to ſeek the Guidance of God's Counſell, and to walk always by it, to follow that Light which he hath held forth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:42122:182"/>us in his Word of Truth, eſpecially by his Son, <hi>the Light of the world, the Way, the Truth, and the Life,</hi> by whom alone we can <hi>goe to the Father,</hi> without whom we <hi>walk in darkneſs,</hi> and <hi>know not whither we goe.</hi> Without this Guidance we can doe nothing as we ought, but, as men driven by our Luſts, or ſeduced by Satan, we are hurried violently, or tamely drawn into thoſe By-paths which lead down to <hi>the Chambers of</hi> eternall <hi>Death.</hi>

            <p>WHAT was the Occaſion of compoſing this Pſalm, is uncertain. Whether it were after or before his Entrance into his Kingdom, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore or after his Victory over <hi>Abſalom;</hi> ſure it is, it was made by <hi>David</hi> when he was in an holy frame of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. And in it he firſt beſpeaks God as a Supplicant, v. 1. then expoſtulates with his inſolent Adverſaries for their Malignity towards him, verſ. 2. declares his Aſſurance of Divine Election and Tuition, verſ. 3. admoniſhes them how to rectifie themſelves, verſ. 4, 5. mentions the Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the generality of men, with his Requeſt for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, verſ. 6. acknowledges the meliority of his Choice, verſ. 7. and thereupon infers this Reſolution which I have read, <hi>I will both lay me down in peace, and ſleep,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>There is no difficulty about the Reading or Meaning of the words: whether we reade, <hi>[together, in id ipſum,]</hi> as the <hi>Vulgar Latin;</hi> or <hi>[both,]</hi> as our Tranſlation:
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:42122:184"/>whether we reade, <hi>[Thou, Lord, onely,]</hi> (referring to his ſingle Help;) or, <hi>[Thou, Lord, makeſt me alone]</hi> (though I have no other with me) <hi>dwell in Safety,</hi> Hope, Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, or Security.</p>
            <p>This Paſſage ſhews his ſettled Acquieſcence in the Tuition of the Almighty, grounded upon his experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and knowledge of his Love and Favour, without any ſuch anxious Thoughtfulneſs, enfeebling Fears, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting Perplexities, as others in the like Diſtreſſes and Deſtitutions (to thoſe he was in) were wont to be oppreſſed with.</p>
            <p>It is likely <hi>David,</hi> when he ſpeaks of his <hi>laying him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf down in peace, and ſleeping,</hi> meant it onely of his natural Sleep, and his addreſſing himſelf thereto. To which ſenſe thoſe words lead us, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 3.5. where he ſaith, <hi>I laid me down and ſlept; I awaked, for the Lord ſuſtained me.</hi> And probably the Occaſion of this Pſalm was the ſame with that of the Third Pſalm, which he made when he fled from <hi>Abſalom</hi> his Son. And likely enough it might be a magnanimous Reply to the Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſome of his timorous Servants, (who perhaps would have had him to have cowardly become a Fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, when the Revolt from him was ſo great, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one was ready to ſhift for himſelf,) That his Heart was not ſo dejected by that Inſurrection, but that he (though he were alone, compaſſed with <hi>ten thouſands of people, that ſet themſelves againſt him round about</hi>) could in Affiance upon Divine Providence, as quietly lie down, and take his Reſt on the Ground, as if he were on his Bed in his Palace at <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> as knowing, that though there were none with him in that condition, yet the Vigilancy of God would be as ſufficient for his Safety, as if he had been lodged in his ſtrong Caſtle at <hi>Sion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet may the words be extended farther, (with ſome
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:42122:184"/>Commentatours,) to denote the Diſpoſition of belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Souls, in addreſſing themſelves with courage to their Death and Grave, (which is termed a <hi>putting off this Tabernacle,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.14. and a <hi>Reſting in their Beds,</hi> Iſa. 57.2.) through the Aſſurance which they have, that when <hi>their Houſe of this Tabernacle is diſſolved, they have a Building of God, an Houſe not made with hands, eternal in the Heavens,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.1. And what <hi>David</hi> ſaith here of himſelf, whether con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his Reſolution, or Aſſurance, each pious Soul, that hath learned to truſt in God, may with a like Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſedneſs of ſpirit and Confidence, Fortitude and Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimity, take up, and ſay, <hi>I will both lay me down in peace, and ſleep:</hi> (either in my Bed or Grave:) <hi>for thou, Lord, onely</hi> (without any other Garriſon) <hi>makeſt me alone</hi> (without any other Company) <hi>to dwell</hi> in my houſe (either on Earth or in the Heavens) <hi>in Safety,</hi> Hope and Security; notwithſtanding the Power and Plots of my Earthly or Infernal Enemies.

               <p>It was no news to <hi>David,</hi> that God's Power is no whit abated by the Multitude of Enemies, and the want of Helpers. <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Victory over the Kings that took <hi>Sodom, Pharaoh</hi>'s Overthrow at the Red Sea, <hi>Sampſon</hi>'s Slaughter of the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> with the Jaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone of an Aſs, his carrying away the Gates of <hi>Azzah, Shamgar</hi>'s ſlaying of 600 <hi>Philiſtines</hi> with an Ox-goad, <hi>Jonathan</hi> and his Armour-bearer's Victory over the ſame People, were ſuch Examples as made <hi>his Heart</hi> to be <hi>fixed,</hi> and <hi>not to ſhrink at evil Tidings.</hi>

               <p>This excellent Temper of ſpirit in Holy Believers ariſeth from the Conſcience of their Integrity, and the vigour of their Faith.

               <p>It is ſo in like manner with all that doe the Will of God.

            <p>It is Goodneſs, and not Greatneſs, we are deſirous to ſee, and do freely remember, and pleaſingly celebrate. We ſometimes are willing to hear of the Exaltation of another, and are ready to magnify it: but not without Regret of mind, unleſs there be a Complication of Goodneſs with Greatneſs. The Magnificence of a great Prince is a pleaſing Object to us, when we know him to be gracious, kind, mercifull, and bountifull: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, what-ever we doe with our Eyes and Knees and Tongues, yet our Hearts are averſe from him. But when theſe concurre, when Power is tempered with Love, and that Love is a cordiall Benevolence, as it is in my Text; then it deſerves a <hi>Videte,</hi> as here, <hi>Behold what manner of love,</hi> &amp;c. Which leads me to the next thing.</p>
            <p n="2">II. The Authour: it is the Love of <hi>the Father.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Love of a Friend is highly valued by us. How doth <hi>David</hi> celebrate the Love of <hi>Jonathan</hi> to himſelf? <hi>My Brother Jonathan, very pleaſant haſt thou been unto me; thy Love to me was wonderfull,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.26. And indeed his Love was admirable, who preferred a Friend before a Father, who endeavoured to preſerve him whom his Father ſought to deſtroy; yea, then ſtuck faſt to him, when he might, and perhaps did, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that <hi>David</hi>'s Advancement to the Throne of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> would be his and his Poſteritie's Ruine.</p>
            <p>Yet this Love is not comparable to the Love of a Father. A Father loves his Child, though his Child loves not him. A Father loves his Child, and will doe him good before himſelf: will, like <hi>Zalencus,</hi> pluck out his Eye, to preſerve his Child's; venture and caſt away his Life, to ſave his Child's. Fathers care little what they eat, wear, undergoe, how they labour, ſo as their Children be well, and well provided for. And ſuch is the Love that S. <hi>John</hi> calls to us to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:42122:190"/>
               <hi>Behold what manner of Love the Father hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed on us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>God is <hi>the Father</hi> by way of excellency, the Father of Fathers; the Univerſall Father, who hath formed all things; the Father of all Men, for <hi>we are all his Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring,</hi> Act. 17.28. But in a peculiar manner he is <hi>the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> the <hi>Son of his Love,</hi> Col. 1.3. He proclaimed from Heaven, (<hi>Matth.</hi> 3.17.) <hi>This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</hi> His orient brighteſt Love ſhines moſt directly in its Zenith on <hi>Chriſt;</hi> he is under the Line: but it ſhines alſo on us from him; <hi>He hath made us accepted,</hi> or Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites, <hi>in the beloved,</hi> Eph. 1.6. And ſo he is become the Father of all the Saints adopted in <hi>Chriſt Jeſus, and</hi> made <hi>the Children of God by Faith in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> Gal. 3.26. 'Tis this Father's Love that is here preſented to be ſeen; His, who is ſtyled <hi>the Father of Mercies, the God of all Conſolation,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.3. <hi>the Father of Lights, from whom every good and every perfect Gift cometh, with whom is no Variableneſs or ſhadow of turning,</hi> Jam. 1.17. the Father who is Love it ſelf in the abſtract, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.16. <hi>God is love.</hi> It is not an Accident in him, but his very Eſſence; ſo that if he ceaſe to love, he ceaſeth to be. <hi>Dulce nomen Patris,</hi> The Name of a Father is a ſweet Name; eſpecially of ſuch a Father.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I will goe to my Father,</hi> ſaid the Prodigall Son, when he knew not what to doe, being brought into great Extremities. Though he had waſted his Eſtate by playing the Unthrift, yet he ſaith, <hi>I will ariſe, and goe to my Father, and ſay unto him, I have ſinned againſt Heaven, and in thy ſight, and am no more worthy to be called thy Son:</hi> and his Father meets him, hath Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion on him, runs to him, falls on his Neck and kiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes him, puts on him the beſt Robe, a Ring on his hand, Shoes on his feet, kills the fatted Calf, eats and
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:42122:191"/>drinks and is merry with him, after all his Miſcarriages. <hi>Luk.</hi> 15. So forcible, ſo free, ſo indulgent, ſo active, ſo conſtant and ſo unalterable is the Love of a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>If there be ſo much Water in a River, there is more in the Ocean: if ſo much Love in an Earthly Father, there is infinitely more in the Heavenly Father. <hi>Be you perfect,</hi> ſaith our Lord, (<hi>Matth.</hi> 5.48.) <hi>as your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which is in Heaven is perfect.</hi> As he is perfect in all his Attributes, his Wiſedome, Power, Truth, Juſtice; ſo alſo in his Love. Whence it is that his Love is an everlaſting Love: <hi>I have loved thee with an everlaſting Love; therefore with Loving-kindneſs have I drawn thee,</hi> ſaith God in the Prophet, <hi>Jerem.</hi> 31.3. His Love is an unchangeable Love; his <hi>Gifts and Calling are without Repentance,</hi> Rom. 11.29. His Love is a preventing Love, bears date afore ours: 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.19. <hi>We love him, becauſe he firſt loved us.</hi> His Love is a moſt pure Love, it hath no ſordid End, no mercenary Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive. <hi>I doe not this,</hi> ſaith God, <hi>for your ſakes, O Houſe of Iſrael, but for my Holy Name's ſake,</hi> Ezek. 36.22. It is pure Goodneſs, meer Love, that ſets God on work to doe good to us: it is the Love of a Father, which hath no reaſon from without him, but from his own nature: it is a moſt active Love, not in ſhew onely, but <hi>in deed and</hi> in <hi>truth:</hi> it is an immenſe Love, that hath a <hi>Height</hi> and a <hi>Depth,</hi> a <hi>Length</hi> and a <hi>Breadth,</hi> without bounds: a rich Love; <hi>God who is rich in Mercies, for his great Love wherewith he hath loved us, even when we were dead in Sins, hath quickned us together with Chriſt,</hi> Eph. 2.4, 5. a Love ſo ample and full, that he <hi>gave his own Son for us,</hi> and <hi>with him hath freely given us all things,</hi> Rom. 8.32. And all is done <hi>gratis,</hi> without Fee or Compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, which is next to be obſerved.</p>
            <pb n="377" facs="tcp:42122:191"/>
            <p n="3">III. The Freeneſs of it: it is <hi>given</hi> or <hi>beſtowed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Donatur,</hi> (ſay the Civill Lawyers) <hi>quod nullo Jure cogente conceditur:</hi> That is ſaid to be given, which cannot by any Law be enforced. Sure that Love which the Father vouchſafes to us is ſuch, as there was no Reaſon to demand it, no Title whereupon to claim it. It was Love to us before we thought of it. <hi>I was found,</hi> ſaith God, (<hi>Rom.</hi> 10.20.) <hi>of them that ſought me not; I was made manifeſt to them that asked not after me.</hi> Yea, <hi>God commendeth his Love towards us, in that while we were yet Sinners Chriſt died for us: When we were Enemies, we were reconciled to God by the Death of his Son,</hi> Rom. 5.8, 10. There was nothing in us but Hatred of God, when he loved us: and we were ſo far from any Merit <hi>de Condigno,</hi> of Condignity, or <hi>de Congruo,</hi> of Congruity, that indeed there was the greateſt Demerit in us. So far were we from deſerving God's Love, that we rather merited to be rejected by him, (by reaſon of our many Provocations of him to Anger,) as the proper Fruit of our Demeanour. <hi>The Wages of Sin is Death: but the Gift of God is eternall Life through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord,</hi> Rom. 6.23.</p>
            <p>Nor could there be any After-dutifulneſs which might be accounted a fit and juſt Compenſation on our part for ſuch Love. <hi>Who</hi> is there that <hi>gives any thing to God firſt?</hi> Rom. 11.35. Surely when we bring forth any Fruit to God, it is but what is of his own Cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. <hi>Chriſt</hi> is <hi>the Vine, his Father is the Husbandman,</hi> (and <hi>we are God's Husbandry,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.9.) he it is that <hi>purgeth the Branches</hi> in <hi>Chriſt, that they may bring forth more Fruit,</hi> Joh. 15.1, 2. <hi>Neither is he that planteth any thing, nor he that watereth, but God that giveth the increaſe,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.7. <hi>Who maketh thee to differ from another? and what haſt thou that thou didſt not receive?</hi> ſaith the ſame Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.7. Yea, were it ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined,
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:42122:192"/>(to ſuppoſe an Impoſſibility,) that we could of our ſelves, by our own Free will, by the Light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſo ingratiate ourſelves with God, as to procure his Favour; that we could obtain <hi>Arte propriâ,</hi> by our own Skill, or <hi>Marte proprio,</hi> by our own Ability, our Filiation, our Regeneration, our Adoption to be God's Sons: yet were not God ingaged by any Worth of our Actions to yield it us; this were no Purchace, no Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change of <hi>quid pro quo,</hi> no advantaging God, that he might benefit us. Rightly ſaith <hi>Elihu,</hi> Job 35.7, 8. <hi>If thou be Righteous, when giveſt thou to him? or what receiveth he of thy hand? Thy Wickedneſs may hurt a man, as thou art; and thy Righteouſneſs may profit the ſon of man.</hi> But, alas! all that in ſuch a caſe we could doe, all that <hi>Adam</hi> himſelf in his Innocency and Integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty could have done, could not have given us ſuch a Claim, as that we could have challenged our Adoption as due to us according to diſtributive Juſtice, in an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rithmetical or Geometrical proportion between our Actings and God's Adoption; but that ſtill it muſt be taken as the free Gift <hi>liberrimi Agentis,</hi> of the moſt free Agent, as the effect of the pureſt and moſt immenſe Love. And therefore well ſaid the Apoſtle, <hi>Behold what manner of Love the Father hath beſtowed on us,</hi> of free Gift, <hi>that we ſhould be called the Sons of God.</hi> Which is the next thing to be conſidered.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. The effect of this Love of God: <hi>that we ſhould be called,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Sons of God</hi> are of many ſorts. The Magiſtrates are ſo by Office, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 82.6. the Angells by Dignity, <hi>Job</hi> 1.6. <hi>Adam</hi> by Creation, <hi>Luk.</hi> 3.38. and ſo all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men, <hi>Act.</hi> 17.29. the Poſterity of <hi>Seth,</hi> (as it is conceived) <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.2. by Profeſſion; our Lord <hi>Chriſt</hi> is <hi>his own Son</hi> by peculiar and eternal Generation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.32. All Believers are his Sons by Regeneration:
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:42122:192"/>
               <hi>As many as received him, to them he gave power to be the Sons of God, even to as many as believe in his name; which were born not of bloud, nor of the will of the fleſh, nor of the will of man, but of God,</hi> Joh. 1.12, 13. By Adoption: God <hi>having predeſtinated us unto the Adoption of Children by Jeſus Chriſt to himſelf, according to the good pleaſure of his Will, to the praiſe of the glory of his Grace,</hi> Eph. 1.5, 6. Regeneration is by a Change of us inwardly, whereby we are <hi>renewed in the Spirit of our minds, and put on the New man, which after God is created in Righteouſneſs and Holineſs of truth,</hi> Eph. 4.23, 24. Adoption is an Act which alters the outward Eſtate, whereby a perſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes as a Son to another, as <hi>Moſes</hi> was to <hi>Pharaoh's Daughter,</hi> Heb. 11.24. It is <hi>Naturae ſimilitudo, ut Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lium quis habere poſſit quem non generaverit;</hi> (<hi>Gaius</hi> Inſt. l. tit. 5.) an Imitation of Nature, whereby a perſon may have another man's Child, as if he were his own Son: ſo that he is his Child by a Legal Right, though not by naturall Birth; and is to own his Adopter as his Father, and he the adopted as his Child. And it is this that S. <hi>John</hi> here means, <hi>Behold what manner of Love the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath given us, that we ſhould be called,</hi> by reaſon of our Regeneration and Adoption, <hi>the Sons of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And not onely that we ſhould be ſo <hi>called,</hi> as if it imported a meer Title, Appellation, or <hi>(nudum &amp; ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne Nomen)</hi> a bare and empty Name. Sure this Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as it is by the beſt, higheſt, richeſt Father, ſo it is to the beſt, greateſt, and moſt ample Benefits. He that is thus the Son of God by Faith in <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> hath the Name, the Dignity, the Honour of a Son of God; hath <hi>the Spirit of his Son, crying Abba, Father,</hi> Gal. 4.6. hath the Apparel of a Son of God, the <hi>white Linen, which is the Righteouſneſs of Saints;</hi> hath the Proviſion, Protection, Attendance of a Child of God, <hi>the Angells are miniſtring Spirits</hi> to him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.14. The Spirit of
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:42122:193"/>God is his; he is a Member of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Body; the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes are his. He hath the Society of Saints on Earth, and <hi>is come to the Church of the firſt-born that are written in Heaven. All things are his, Paul, Apollos, Cephas, Life, Death, things preſent, things to come; and he is Chriſt's, and Chriſt God's,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.22, 23. <hi>If</hi> he be <hi>a Son, then an Heir, an Heir of God, a Joynt-heir with Chriſt,</hi> Rom. 8.17. And can more Favour be deſired or imagined to be done by the moſt Holy and High God to ſuch Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gars, Malefactours, Rebells, condemned Priſoners, ſuch baſe contemptible Wretches as we are? We may here cry out with the Apoſtle, <hi>O the depth of the Riches both of the Wiſedome and Knowledge</hi> (I may adde, <hi>and Love</hi>) <hi>of God! how unſearchable are his Judgments, and his Ways paſt finding out!</hi> Rom. 11.33. With the greateſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon then doth S. <hi>John</hi> call upon us to <hi>behold</hi> this: which is the laſt thing to be conſidered.</p>
            <p n="5">V. The Adverb of demonſtration, inviting us to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider this Love: <hi>Behold what manner,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And this may alſo ſerve for the</p>

               <p>This is then the Uſe to be made of what hath been ſaid (and, did time permit, might be more amply decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red) of the Love of God in our Adoption; that we are to <hi>behold</hi> it, not ſo much with the Eye of our Body, as with the Eye of our Mind. Sure the Apoſtle S. <hi>Paul</hi> thought this to be of ſo great conſequence, that he <hi>cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed not to make mention</hi> of the <hi>Epheſian</hi> Believers <hi>in his Prayers, that the God of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Glory, might give them the Spirit of wiſedom and revelation in the knowledge of Chriſt;</hi> that <hi>the eyes of their <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding being enlightned, they might know what is the hope of his Calling, and what the riches of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:42122:193"/>of his Inheritance in the Saints, and what is the excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding greatneſs of his Power to us-ward, who believe,</hi> Eph. 1.16, 17, 18, 19. This of all things is moſt worthy our Contemplation; our moſt full, conſtant, accurate Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. We ſhould behold it in all the Effects of it in us, and towards us. Every Motion of his Spirit, every Providence in eſcaping Temptations, every Goſpel-Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, every Prayer we make, invite us to this Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation.</p>
               <p>You that are to receive the Holy Sacrament, what o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Buſineſs have you but to <hi>taſt how gracious the Lord is?</hi> The Lord's Supper is <hi>viſibile Verbum,</hi> a viſible Word, that minds you of this Love of God, in giving his Son for you, to make you his Sons. Look not then ſo much on what <hi>Chriſt</hi> did, as why; that it was for you. See your own Unworthineſs; be humbled for your Sins: but <hi>behold</hi> the Riches of God's Love. See it ſo as to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire it, ſo as to praiſe it. Let this be an Euchariſt, a Thankſgiving. Doe that on Earth that the Saints in Heaven now doe; Receive it with <hi>Hallelujahs</hi> in your Hearts, if not with your Tongues.</p>
               <p>Remember this with rejoycing in God, Hope in him, Prayer to him, as your Father; Love to him, who ſo lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved you; Love to each other, as being <hi>one Body and one Bread,</hi> being <hi>partakers of this one Bread,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.17.</p>
               <p>But chiefly behold it with Reverence and Dutifulneſs to your Father; <hi>that you may be blameleſs,</hi> and ſincere, <hi>and harmleſs, the Sons of God, without rebuke in the midſt of a crooked and perverſe generation, among whom ye</hi> are to <hi>ſhine as Lights in the world,</hi> Phil. 2.15. <hi>Amen.</hi>

            <p>OF all the Pſalms, there is none which hath ſo much of Curioſity, and yet ſo much Plainneſs, as this. In the Form of it, is much Poeticall Art: in the Matter of it, much Integrity and Holineſs of Heart. The Art is ſeen in obſerving the order of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Letters, in aſſigning to each Letter eight Verſes, and beginning every Verſe in every Octonary with the ſame Letter. The Integrity and Holineſs of Heart is obſervable in the Expreſſions, which for the moſt part contain Proteſtations of Integrity, or holy Petitions; both which are in the words I have read to you: in which are contained,

               </p>
               <p>If we will believe the wiſeſt of men, this will be out of doubt. It is the main Argument of many Chapters in the Book of <hi>Solomon's Proverbs,</hi> (the Quinteſſence of his Wiſedom,) to commend to us, as the moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious thing that can be choſen, the Underſtanding of God's Laws; which he calls <hi>the Fear of the Lord,</hi> and <hi>the Knowledge of God,</hi> Prov. 2.5. And Chap. 3.14, 15. he ſaith, <hi>The merchandiſe thereof is better then the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandiſe of Silver, and the gain thereof then fine Gold. She is more precious then Rubies; and all the things thou canſt deſire are not to be compared unto her.</hi> Again, <hi>Prov.</hi> 4.7. <hi>Wiſedom is the principal thing; therefore get Wiſedom, and with all thy getting get <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhould recite to you a great part of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Books, and of the Pſalms of <hi>David</hi> his Father, beſides other parcells of Holy Scripture, ſhould I heap up all thoſe Paſſages which ſet out the Worth of the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding God's Laws.

               <p>Any right Knowledge is deſirable, ſince every man is ambitious to know; ſaith <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> in the firſt words of his Metaphyſicks. It is true, there is <hi>Science falſely ſo called,</hi> as the Apoſtle's phraſe is, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.20. which learned Interpreters conceive to be meant of the <hi>Gno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks</hi> pretended Knowledge, (from whence they uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped the Title of <hi>Gnoſticks,</hi> that is <hi>Knowing men,</hi>) of the thirty <hi>Aeones,</hi> and ſuch like Fables, deviſed by <hi>Valentius</hi> and other like Hereticks, to draw Diſciples from the Chriſtian Doctrine after them: of which much may be ſeen in <hi>Irenaeus</hi> his Five Books againſt Hereſies. Theſe alſo, or ſome other Fanatick Hereticks of that Time, are conceived to be meant by them that <hi>know the Depths of Satan, as they ſpeak,</hi> Rev. 2.24. Such kind of Knowledge the Apoſtle bids <hi>Timothy not to give heed to,</hi> as the <hi>Fables, and endleſs Genealogies,</hi> whether of <hi>Gnoſticks</hi> or <hi>Jews,</hi> and as <hi>miniſtring Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions, rather then godly Edifying which is in Faith,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.4. which he calls <hi>profane and old wives Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,</hi> to be <hi>refuſed,</hi> Chap. 4.7. <hi>perverſe Diſputings of men of corrupt minds, and deſtitute of the Truth,</hi> to be avoided, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.5. <hi>fooliſh and unlearned Queſtions, which engender Strife,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.23. <hi>profane and vain Babblings, which encreaſe unto more <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngodlineſs,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.16. <hi>Jewiſh Fables, and Commandments of men that turn from the Truth,</hi> Tit. 1.14. Fooliſh Queſtions and Genealogies, and Contentions and Strivings about the Law, which are unprofitable and vain, ſuch as the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baliſtical Conceits and Talmudical Dotages of <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Rabbins have been of old, and of later days many of the Popes Decretall Epiſtles, many of the Monks Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendary Tales in their Book which they termed <hi>Aurea Legenda,</hi> the Golden Legend, (though <hi>Ludovicus Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves</hi> ſaith true, He that deviſed it had a Brazen Face, he that believes it a Leaden Heart;) all theſe, and
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:42122:196"/>what-ever is of like ſtamp, are to be abhorred, as co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming from Satan to <hi>corrupt mens minds from the Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity that is in Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But all true Knowledge, of what kind ſoever, is juſtly deſirable, as being both an Ornament, and ſome way or other uſefull to Man, whoſe Excellency, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he exceeds Beaſts, is his Knowledge: and his Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority to Angels, is his Defect in it. And though ſome of late have endeavoured to prejudice the minds of men againſt the Study of Arts, Sciences, Languages, and other Learning taught in Univerſities: yet it is for no other Reaſon, but becauſe of their own Illite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rateneſs. <hi>Scientia neminem habet Inimicum, niſi Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantem:</hi> No man undervalues Learning, but the Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſs ſome Knowledge is more deſirable then other; and above all the reſt, the Knowledge of God, his Laws, Will, Counſell, Works: which indeed make men more truly wiſe then the Knowledge of all the Secrets of Nature, Policies of State, humane Arts and Sciences. Princely Wiſedom to Govern, is a very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Gift. To have the Underſtanding which <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> had, to judge and rule ſo great a People as that of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> was a very glorious Gift of God, and ſuch as made him renowned above all the men of the earth in his days, and many Ages after: yet he found a Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in this. <hi>I gave my heart,</hi> ſaith he, (<hi>Eccles.</hi> 1.17, 18.) <hi>to know Wiſedom, and to know Madneſs and Folly: I perceived that this alſo is Vexation of ſpirit. For in much Wiſedom is much Grief: and he that increaſeth Knowledge increaſeth Sorrow.</hi> Be he the wiſeſt States<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, or profoundeſt Scholar, be he <hi>Doctor profundus, Angelicus, Seraphicus,</hi> though he have gotten thoſe glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Titles wherewith ſome have ſet out them whom they have eſteemed; yet if he review his Projects, his
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:42122:196"/>Writings, he will find cauſe to repent of them, to ſay, <hi>Non putâram,</hi> This I conſidered not, to make Retracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions with S. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> to charge himſelf with Folly and Errour. That which we reade <hi>Prov.</hi> 9.10. is a Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ime <hi>aeternae veritatis,</hi> of eternal truth, <hi>The Knowledge of the Holy is <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding.</hi> That Knowledge which is of God and his Will, that is practical as well as ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culative, is the true Underſtanding.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe it is the Knowledge of the moſt excellent Object. We much prize the Knowledge of the moſt abſtruſe things, the things moſt abſtract from ſenſe. The Knowledge of Tranſcendents, Stars, Motions, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences of the Heavens, Angels and Spirits, is with much Curioſity inquired into: and they are rare Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours who can diſcover ſuch ſublime things. But the Knowledge of God, his Properties, Ways, Precepts and Counſels, is far more excellent, as being of more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious things. We think the Knowledge of Reaſons of State, <hi>Arcana Imperii,</hi> the Art of Governing Men and Kingdoms, more excellent then the Knowledge of Husbandry, how to order Beaſts, to plough and ſow and plant; to be a wiſe Stateſman, more excellent then to be a skilfull Ruſtick. But Theology is much to be preferred before any of theſe; yea a Doctour in Divinity before a Phyſician or a Lawyer, as teaching the things of God, which are moſt abſtruſe, and of high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Speculation. To be wiſe in theſe things, is to be <hi>wiſe as Daniel,</hi> who is made the Pattern of a wiſe man, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 28.3. becauſe <hi>the Spirit of God</hi> was <hi>in him, Light and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding</hi> to reveal the Secrets of God. Yea, it is to be wiſe <hi>as an Angel of God,</hi> Angels being proverbially made the Exemplar of Wiſedom, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14.17. whoſe excellency of Knowledge ſtands in their <hi>beholding God's Face:</hi> by which (though not as in a natural Glaſs, according to the Conceit of them that
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:42122:197"/>talk of <hi>Speculum Trinitatis,</hi> a Glaſs of the Trinity, as if he that ſees God, muſt know all things, by ſeeing him that ſees all things; that's an Errour, for then the Angels ſhould be Omniſcient: but in a free, clear Glaſs,) they ſee more of his Glory and Works, receive more immediate Orders from him, underſtand more of the affairs of Heaven and Divine Myſteries, then men <hi>that dwell in houſes of Clay;</hi> and the more is revealed unto them of God's Actings, Intendments or Appointments, the more do they increaſe in Wiſedom.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe this Knowledge of God is the moſt true, clear, certain, ſatisfying Knowledge. There is Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in all other Knowledge, as there is in the things that are known. He that knows moſt and beſt of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther matters, yet finds no Reſt or Satisfaction in them. There is Uncertainty even in ſome things in the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicks; and in thoſe things that are known beſt, there is no great Content to the mind by their Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, becauſe it is but of things that ſhall end. <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> of humane things <hi>ſhall vaniſh away,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.8. How many thouſands of Learned men have at laſt, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all their Studying, Arguing, Writing, Reading, come to <hi>Socrates</hi> his Determination, <hi>Hoc unum ſcio, quòd Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hil ſcio;</hi> I know this one thing, that I know Nothing? How many, the more they plod on the things of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Art, are the more puzzled? One that was counted a great Wit of the world, when he had ſtudied the Cauſe of the Sea's Motions, but could not comprehend it, threw himſelf into it, with this Saying, <hi>Quoniam ego non capio te, tu capies me;</hi> Becauſe I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not perceive thee, thou ſhalt receive me.</p>
               <p>But in the Knowledge of God, his Will, his Laws and Counſels, is Perfection. <hi>Quietat Intellectum:</hi> The Clearneſs, Truth, Beauty, Stability of the Knowledge and things known, ſatisfie the Mind. <hi>I have ſeen an
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:42122:197"/>end of all Perfection: but thy Commandment is excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding broad,</hi> ſaith <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 119.96. There are <hi>wonderous things in God's Law,</hi> verſ. 18. There is no Sophiſtry or Fallacy in any of God's Words; there is none of the Poiſon of <hi>the old Serpent, which deceiveth the whole world:</hi> But, (as it is <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.7, 8, 9.) <hi>The Law of the Lord is perfect, converting,</hi> or <hi>reſtoring, the Soul: the Teſtimony of the Lord is ſure, making wiſe the Simple. The Statutes of the Lord are right, rejoycing the Heart: the Commandment of the Lord is pure, enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Eyes. The Fear of the Lord is clean, enduring for ever: the Judgments of the Lord are true and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous altogether.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The Knowledge of God and his Law is moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable, becauſe it is that Knowledge which pleaſeth God moſt. 'Tis true, all the Works of God are worth the knowing: <hi>The Works of the Lord are great, ſought out of all them that have pleaſure therein,</hi> Pſal. 111.2. God allows us to ſearch out the Secrets of Nature; and it is a great Excellency in men, to find out the hidden Qualities and Virtues of Natural Bodies: but to terminate our Knowledge on them, and <hi>not to have reſpect to the Maker of them, not to look unto him that faſhioned</hi> the World <hi>long agoe,</hi> as the Prophet ſpeaks <hi>Iſa.</hi> 22.11. much more to deny his Work, to aſcribe it to a caſual Concourſe of Atoms, to the Nature of the things themſelves, without acknowledging the Firſt Cauſe, <hi>Primum Motorem,</hi> the Firſt Mover and Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall Efficient, is monſtrous Madneſs, and a thing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely odious to the Divine Majeſty.</p>
               <p>Yea, they that are the greateſt Philoſophers, if they know not God's Will, have not Underſtanding how to worſhip God, and to doe his Pleaſure, are uſually more brutiſh then others: they are <hi>given up to vile Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, to a reprobate Mind, to doe thoſe things which
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:42122:198"/>are not convenient,</hi> but <hi>againſt Nature,</hi> ſuch as Beaſts doe not, and none but beſotted or bewitched men would doe.</p>
               <p>Some kind of Knowledge is utterly forbidden us. Well did thoſe Converts (mentioned <hi>Act.</hi> 19.19.) who <hi>uſed curious Arts,</hi> when they <hi>brought their Books toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and burned them before all men;</hi> though <hi>counting the Price of them, they found it fifty thouſand pieces of Silver.</hi> All Knowledge of infernall Magick is abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to God. Then our Knowledge pleaſeth God, when <hi>we follow on to know the Lord,</hi> Hoſ. 6.3. when we underſtand what he reveals to us for our Duty and his Honour. <hi>The ſecret things belong unto the Lord our God: but thoſe things which are revealed belong unto us and our Children for ever, that we may doe all the words of his Law,</hi> Deut. 29.29.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Becauſe the Underſtanding of God and his Law, or Will, is that which is of greateſt Advantage to us, and therefore moſt to be deſired by us. It is true which <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 2.13, 14. that <hi>Wiſedom excelleth Folly, as far as Light excelleth Darkneſs. The Wiſe man's eyes are in his head;</hi> he avoideth many Dangers, takes proſperous Courſes, by reaſon of his Prudence in diſcerning between things hurtfull and things helpfull to him: for want of which <hi>the Fool walketh in Darkneſs,</hi> ſtumbles often, and falls into Pits and Precipices. Yet, as he ſaith verſ. 15, 16. <hi>as it happeneth to the Fool, ſo to the Wiſe; as the Fool</hi> dieth, ſo <hi>dieth the Wiſe.</hi> Neither doth Wiſedom in Sciences, Arts, Policy, Cunning in Trading, or any ſuch Skill as men are moſt applauded for, (Civil or Military,) ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure a man from Dangers without, or Fears within; common Calamities, or particular Miſeries; Death, or Damnation. But <hi>the Wiſedom that is from above,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we know God's Will, <hi>know the things of the Spirit
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:42122:198"/>of God, which are freely given us of God,</hi> arms us againſt Temptations, Fear of Death and Judgment to come, and comforts us in Tribulation. It is that which <hi>is able to make us wiſe unto Salvation,</hi> as the Holy Scriptures did <hi>Timothy.</hi> It brings us to God, as it comes from God. Which leads us to the</p>

            <div type="observation">
               <head>II. OBSERVATION.</head>
               <p>That the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding of God's Law and Will is the Gift of God, and to be ſought from him.</p>
               <p>Every good and every perfect Gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of Lights, with whom is no Variableneſs, neither ſhadow of turning. <hi>And therefore</hi> if any lack Wiſedom, <hi>he is to</hi> ask it of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not, <hi>James 1.5, 17.</hi> Job, <hi>after his inquiry,</hi> Where ſhall Wiſedom be found? and where is the place of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding? <hi>reſolves,</hi> The Depth ſaith, It is not in me; and the Sea ſaith, It is not in me: Deſtruction and Death ſay, We have heard the fame thereof with our ears. God underſtandeth the way thereof, and he knoweth the place thereof. He declareth it, prepareth it, and ſearcheth it out, <hi>Job 28.12, 14, 22, 23, 27. And indeed it is he onely that gives it, and in ſuch a meaſure as pleaſeth him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>All Underſtanding is God's Gift: he makes the wiſe, and the fooliſh. He can give</hi> Solomon <hi>Wiſedom,</hi> turn Achitophel's Counſel into Folly, make fooliſh the Wiſedom <hi>of the wiſe. As they that truſt to their own Wiſedom,</hi> lean to their own <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding, <hi>do follow an</hi> Ignis fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuus, <hi>that will lead them into Bogs and Precipices: ſo they that ſeek Counſel of God, Wiſedom from him in all their Undertakings, that fear themſelves, and</hi> work out their Salvation with fear and trembling, <hi>are moſt proſperous. It was</hi> Solomon<hi>'s Happineſs, that he asked

And therefore, by</hi> Solomon<hi>'s Example, we ſhould beware of abuſing our Knowledge, by</hi> turning God's Grace into Wantonneſs, <hi>and perverting our Underſtanding to the Service of our Luſts. But, which is the</hi>

            <div type="observation">
               <head>III. OBSERVATION.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>When we underſtand God's Laws, we ſhould obſerve them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Obſervation of God's Law conſiſteth in two things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In Conſidering what it requires, or makes known. The word we tranſlate <hi>[keep]</hi> ſignifies the Obſervance of a Watch-man, who is intent on what he ſees, and attentive to what he hears. And this ſhould be the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition and exerciſe of every one to whom God ſpeaks. <hi>I will hear what God the Lord will ſpeak,</hi> ſaith the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 85.8. There is nothing more concerns a man, then to have his Ear for God, and his Eye on God. All our Happineſs is from him: and therefore all our Thoughts ſhould be towards him. As a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant that depends on his Maſter will have his eye on him, and his ear open to him; ſo ſhould it be with us: our Ear ſhould hear, and our Heart ſhould conſider what God ſpeaks or acts. The <hi>Bleſſed man's Delight is in the Law of the Lord, and in his Law doth he medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate day and night,</hi> Pſal. 1.2. And what-ever God does in the world, eſpecially towards us, whereby he either anſwers our Prayers, or rebukes us for our Sins, either warns us of our evil Doings, or encourages us in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well, ſhould be obſerved by us; for by ſo doing
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:42122:199"/>we ſhew we have an Heart to pleaſe God, and cauſe him to take pleaſure in us.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In Doing of God's Law, according to what we underſtand, whether it be by <hi>departing from Evil,</hi> or <hi>doing Good. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto Man he ſaid, Behold, the Fear of the Lord, that is Wiſedom; and to depart from Evil, that is <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding,</hi> Job 28.28. As God's Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts cannot be obſerved without learning them; ſo are they not well learned, unleſs they be obſerved. Theology is a practical Science, for Action as well as Speculation. <hi>If ye know theſe things,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Chriſt</hi>) <hi>hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py are ye if ye doe them,</hi> Joh. 13.17.

                  <hi>That God's Laws are to be kept by us with our whole Heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And indeed God's Law is not kept, unleſs the Heart keep it as well as the Tongue: His Service requires the Inward parts as well as the Outward. <hi>Apply thine Heart to Inſtruction, and thine Ears to the word of Knowledge.

               <p>It is the Heart that is the Principle or Fountain of good or bad. <hi>A good man, out of the good treaſure of his Heart, bringeth forth good things: and an evil man, out of the evil treaſure, bringeth forth evil,</hi> Matth. 12.35. The moſt glorious Works of Piety or Charity, that come not from a right Principle within, pleaſe God no more then the <hi>offering of Swines bloud:</hi> yea, God counts himſelf mocked, when our Prayers, Praiſes, or any Duties we doe, come not from the Heart. Heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Service is no Service of God, but a Deriſion of him. He that <hi>is a Spirit, muſt be ſerved with the Spirit,</hi> or elſe the Service is abhorred.</p>
               <p>Nor muſt God's Law be kept with a part, but with the whole Heart. <hi>Bleſſed are they that keep his Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and that ſeek him with the whole Heart,</hi> Pſal. 119.2.

He muſt keep them in all his Faculties: in his Mind, by conſidering them; in his Memory, by retaining them; in his Purpoſes, by chuſing them; and in his Affections, by adhering to them. He muſt keep them with all his Might, with the utmoſt degree of Obſervance that he can: and wherein he is defective, he muſt bewail himſelf. He muſt not keep any man's Precepts that conſiſt not with God's; not <hi>the Statutes of Omri,</hi> or the Ordinances <hi>of the houſe of Ahab,</hi> Mic. 6.16. A divided Heart, <hi>a double Heart, an Heart and an Heart,</hi> are monſtrous, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 12.2. We <hi>cannot ſerve God, and Mammon.

               <p>You have heard how valuable a thing the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of God's Law is; whence it is derived; to what End it ſhould tend; with what Sincerity that End ſhould be proſecuted. I hope hereby you diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the genuine and true Reaſon why there is ſo little Wiſedom in the world: And I wiſh you would apply your minds to get that Underſtanding which will make you truly wiſe. It is the common Complaint, That the World is full of Fools: and no marvel it ſhould be ſo, ſince each man loves to be his own Guide; and even generally all ſorts of men affect to follow that Darkneſs which they miſs-name <hi>the Light within them,</hi> and are unwilling to be undeceived from their Errours. <hi>Quis intelligit Delicta?</hi> is in this ſenſe true. Though all are <hi>Children in Knowledge;</hi> yet are they loth to abide under the tuition and conduct of their Overſeers. Some miſs-lead themſelves by their Luſts, ſome by their Opinions; few move in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect Line of God's Law: and no marvel then they ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer eclipſes of their innate Light. Earthly-mindedneſs, like the Earth, interpoſing, keeps the Light of God's Word from them: Love of tranſitory Pleaſures hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the Light of the Spirit from ſhining on them. Nor do they lift up their Eyes and Hearts unto <hi>the Sun of Righteouſneſs,</hi> that he may <hi>ariſe</hi> with brightneſs in his Rays upon them.</p>
               <p>It would be infinite to reckon up the Fooleries of Philoſophers, <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Rabbins, Hereticks, Papiſts, and all ſorts of Fanaticks, who have declined from God's Precepts. Let their Errours, their Follies, their Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages, make you inquiſitive into God's Law; wary how you turn aſide from it; diligent to obſerve it;
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:42122:201"/>conſtant in adhering to it; inſtant with <hi>the Father of Lights</hi> to direct your Steps in it. They that ſail at Sea, count it ſafeſt to be in a Ship that hath a good Pilot: They that live in a State, think it happy to live where there are good Laws and good Governours. Sure no Pilot is better then he that ſteers the Courſe of the Heavens; no Laws better then the Laws of the Moſt high; no Government equal to the Government of God. If you leave his Guidance, if you forſake his Laws, you will ſuffer Shipwreck, and be caſt on thoſe barbarous Coaſts where Tyrants and Devils domineer.</p>
               <p>Oh then, what-ever ye doe, prefer the Underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of God's Will before all Knowledge: beg earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of God, that he would teach you: forget not what ye learn of him: let your whole <hi>Heart be ſound in his Precepts.</hi> Doe as <hi>Chriſt</hi> did, whoſe <hi>meat and drink it was to doe the will of his Father;</hi> and you ſhall <hi>eat and drink with him in his Kingdom.</hi> Which he grant, who <hi>loved us, and gave himſelf for us.</hi> To whom, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Amen.</p>

               <p>And herein I ſhall enquire, 1. What is this <hi>Walking in a man's <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>prightneſs:</hi> 2. How this demonſtrates the <hi>Fear of the Lord:</hi> 3. What Advantage accrues to a man that walketh in his Uprightneſs, and feareth the Lord.</p>
               <p>Of theſe in their order.</p>
               <p n="1">I. <hi>What it is for a man to walk in his <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>prightneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Walking</hi> (in the primitive acception thereof) imports a natural progreſſive Motion of the Body: and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>p<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſs</hi> is that Poſition of the Body, according to which it is ſo placed as not to incline to one hand more then the other, but to be even ſet between both. But in the Metaphorical ſenſe, in which hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of times this Expreſſion is uſed in Holy Scripture, it ſignifies the moral Motion of the Mind and Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of a Man, as he is a rational Being, to be regulated by the Law of his Maker. And ſo it ſuppoſeth the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of the Underſtanding, Will, Affections, and Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of a man, in an orderly and conſtant Courſe, out of a vital ſpiritual Principle in him, by a certain Rule, from one term of his Motion to another, for the attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of his End.</p>
               <p>Whence it is evident, that as to Bodily Walking there are many things requiſite or preſuppoſed; ſo to the Spiritual Walking of the Soul or Man in his Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſs,
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:42122:203"/>there belong ſundry things, either as preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed or required, without which he cannot be ſaid to walk in his Uprightneſs. As it is with our Body, while we live on Earth, there will ſtill be ſome Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; <hi>Man is born to Labour, as the Sparks fly upward; God hath given to the ſons of men ſore Travail, to be exerciſed therewith:</hi> ſo it is alſo with the Soul, there are ſtirrings of Thoughts, Deſires, which cauſe elicit Acts of the Will in its Purpoſes; and imperate Acts, in ſetting the Members of the Body on work, for avoiding Evil, or obtaining ſome ſuppoſed Good.</p>
               <p>And as corporal Motion is not in an inſtant, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires Time, more or leſs: ſo for the contriving and proſecuting ſuch Deſigns as the Will pitches upon, the whole Life of man is imployed.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe as there is in Walking, ſome Place or Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon from which or from whom the Motion begins, and to which or whom it tends, which are called in Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy the <hi>Terminus à quo,</hi> the Bound from whence, and the <hi>Terminus ad quem,</hi> the Bound to which it is direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: ſo are there in the moral Actions of the Soul and Members ſome like Bounds; perſons are either turned from God, after Satan, or they are <hi>turned from the power of Satan unto God:</hi> they either move from or to Heaven or Hell, Life or Death.</p>
               <p>And as there is a Way in all Walking of the Body, in which the Motion is performed; <hi>Motus eſt ſuper immobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le,</hi> there muſt be ſome fixt and ſettled thing which men ordinarily walk upon; they do not move as Fiſhes in the Sea, or Birds in the Air, whoſe Way hath no fixed Path: ſo it is in mens Walking ſpiritually; there is a <hi>broad Way which leadeth to Deſtruction,</hi> or a <hi>narrow Way which leadeth to Life;</hi> a Way of Satan's, or a Way of God's, in which every man walks.</p>
               <p>And as there is in man's Walking a vital locomotive
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:42122:204"/>Principle, which is well or ill ordered according to the Sight and the ſtate of the Members, and ſuch Guidance as is from others Direction; ſo that ſometimes for want of Sight or Light a perſon ſtumbles and falls, or by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Miſtakes from himſelf, or Miſ-direction of other perſons, he errs, and never attains to that which he moves towards; ſometimes he proſpers in his Motion, ſeeing his Way aright, heeding it, not fainting, but hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding on to the end of his Journey: So it is in mens Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Walking: there is a wrong and a right Principle which moves their Mind and Will; they <hi>walk after the Fleſh,</hi> or <hi>after the Spirit;</hi> their Way is either Satan's, or God's, his Dictates, or God's Precepts; they <hi>walk in Darkneſs,</hi> or <hi>in the Light:</hi> either they are <hi>weary of well-doing,</hi> and <hi>goe back to Perdition,</hi> and <hi>turn aſide to crooked Ways;</hi> or elſe they diſcern <hi>the Errour of their ways,</hi> chuſe <hi>the Way of Life,</hi> goe on with Alacrity and livelineſs therein, and perſevere to the end.</p>
               <p>Alſo as in Bodily Walking, the Motion is not <hi>per Saltum,</hi> one Step or Leap doth not begin and end it; but it is progreſſive, there is Step after Step, one ſlower, another quicker, one part of the Way is ſooner and with leſs trouble and danger paſſed over then the other: So it is in the Spiritual Walking: the Actings of the Mind and Will are not performed all together, neither the immanent nor tranſient Acts of a man, whether right or wrong, are done at once; but ſome one hour, ſome another, with various Succeſs, with diverſity of Ability, and Speed, and Event, by reaſon of the Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence or Hindrance of concurrent Accidents or Cauſes, which do frequently alter both the Motion and the Conſequence of it: ſuch as are the Temptations of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, or the Influence of God's Spirit; the Society of evil Company, or the Converſe with Godly perſons; corrupt Teachers, or holy Paſtours; outward eſtate of
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:42122:204"/>Proſperity, or Adverſity; with many other things, which occaſion mens Progreſs to be more or leſs expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite, either to the better or the worſe.</p>
               <p>Thus I have ſomewhat opened to you what this Walking is in general: It is now farther neceſſary, that I ſhew you more ſpecially what is this Walking of a man in his Uprightneſs, which ſhews he fears the Lord.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For a man who feareth the Lord to walk in his Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſs, it is neceſſary that he ſet his face towards God, that is, that he propound God's Glory, and the obtaining of his Favour, as his End. In all ſuch Actions as are rational, it is the End propounded by the Doer which hath a chief ſway in the denominating of them good. <hi>Finis dat Mediis Amabilitatem.</hi> Many brave Exploits done by heroical men onely to immortalize their Names, to ſpread their Fame, though they were advantageous to the people of their Generation, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not acted out of Dutifulneſs to God as the impul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, to exalt God as the final Cauſe, they were but <hi>ſplendida Peccata,</hi> gliſtering Sins, like Gloe-worms, or Wood that ſeems to ſhine in the dark, but is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but rotten matter or mere Dirt. He that walks uprightly ſtoops not down to the Earth, nor pores on his own Cloaths, but looks upwards to ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing higher then himſelf, towards Heaven. <hi>Phariſees</hi> Alms, Faſting, Prayers, though much eſteemed by themſelves and other men, were not regarded by God, as being done for themſelves, not for God. But ſuch Actions as are done without Oſtentation, with an eye to God's Approbation, though in ſecret, and of no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count with men, yet are they <hi>in the ſight of God of great price;</hi> as S. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith (1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.4.) of <hi>the hidden man of the Heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet Spirit.</hi> The Rectitude of the Heart is moſt conducible to a man's upright wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king:
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:42122:205"/>which emboldned <hi>Hezekiah</hi> thus to mind God in his Prayer, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 38.3. <hi>Remember now, O Lord, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech thee, how I have walked before thee in truth, and with a perfect Heart, and have done that which is good in thy ſight.</hi> Which acquaints us with the next Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Walking;</p>
               <p n="2">2. It muſt be a Walking in God's Ways. It is not enough for him that walks in his Uprightneſs, that his Intentions be good, but he muſt alſo chuſe the Paths of Uprightneſs; he muſt doe what God requires to be done, and to be done by him. He that ran well, but <hi>extra Viam,</hi> out of the Way appointed him, beyond his Line, had not the Crown aſſigned him by the Judges in the <hi>Greek</hi> Games. Neither hath he the Approbation or Reward of upright Walking, who walks by another Rule then God commands. They that chuſe either their own Conceits, or the <hi>Tradition of the Elders,</hi> or any other humane Authority, for the Square of their Actions, are judged to <hi>worſhip God in vain;</hi> to <hi>draw near him with their Mouth, and</hi> to <hi>honour him with their Lips, but</hi> to <hi>remove their Heart far from him, whoſe Fear towards him is taught by the Precepts of men,</hi> Iſa. 29.13. They are ſuch as eye the Dictates of Rabbins, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of Popes, the Canons of Councils, above or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually with the Precepts of <hi>Chriſt:</hi> they make Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of the Vow of <hi>Corban,</hi> not of <hi>honouring Father and Mother:</hi> they will by no means break the Rules of the Founder of their Order, but ſcruple not the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olating of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Commands. Neither can thoſe be ſaid to walk in their Uprightneſs, that make Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of keeping one Command, but not of another; that will not ſwear, yet will lie; that will pray to God, and yet defraud men; that will give Alms, yet adore a Crucifix; that will <hi>pay Tith of Mint, Aniſe and Cumin, and leave the weightier matters of the Law, Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:42122:205"/>Judgment, Faith, and the Love of God;</hi> that <hi>abhor Idols,</hi> yet <hi>commit Sacrilege.</hi> All upright Walking is co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulative, takes in its Walk all God's Commands; it excludes none, but obſerves all in their due order and place. <hi>Then ſhall I not be aſhamed,</hi> ſaith <hi>David,</hi> (Pſal. 119.6.) <hi>when I have reſpect to all thy Commands.</hi> Yet herein there muſt be heed taken, that we regard each in its proper time. To keep the Sabbath by Reſt, to attend the <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> was a Duty; but not when <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> was to be ſhewed. Vice is to be reproved, but in fit ſeaſon: Sin is to be puniſhed, but by him that is thereto authourized: Sacrifice is to be offered, but by the Prieſt. He that walks in his Uprightneſs muſt not onely look that the thing he does be commanded, but that it be commanded to him. Each muſt walk in his own Path, in his own Rank, if he will walk in his Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſs.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He that walks in his Uprightneſs muſt walk wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, ſteadily, evenly, conſtantly; according to that of <hi>Solomon,</hi> Prov. 4.25, 26, 27. <hi>Let thine eyes look right on, and let thine ey-lids look ſtraight before thee. Ponder the Path of thy feet, and let all thy ways be eſtabliſhed. Turn not to the right hand nor to the left; remove thy foot from Evil.</hi> So ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.15, 16. <hi>See that ye walk circumſpectly, not as fools, but as wiſe, redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the time.</hi> He that walks in his Uprightneſs hath his <hi>Eyes in his head,</hi> to keep his Way; gazeth not about to ſatisfie his Curioſity, but minds his Journey, the Way he is to walk in, the Work he is to doe; liſtens not to ſeducing Company, that ſeeks to divert him out of his Path; takes heed of ſuch Offers, ſuch Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as may be <hi>Stumbling-blocks</hi> to him, to <hi>cauſe him to fall;</hi> ſets his Foot, his Purpoſes firmly, that he may not ſlip; looks not back, like <hi>Lot</hi>'s Wife to <hi>Sodom,</hi> to his former Pleaſures.

                  <hi>Phalti,</hi> when he reſtored <hi>Michal</hi> to <hi>David;</hi> but like <hi>David,</hi> with <hi>enlarged heart</hi> he lifts up his feet to <hi>run the way of God's Commands.</hi> He is <hi>not ſlothfull,</hi> but a diligent <hi>follower of them that through Faith and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience have inherited the Promiſes.</hi> He looks to the <hi>Cloud of Witneſſes</hi> that have gone before him, and keeps company with them who <hi>confeſs themſelves Pilgrims and Strangers on Earth,</hi> and thereby <hi>declare plainly that they ſeek another City, to wit, an heavenly.</hi> He <hi>caſts away every weight, and the Sin that doth ſo eaſily beſet</hi> him, that he may <hi>with patience run the Race that is ſet before</hi> him. Such do arm themſelves againſt Encounters of <hi>Spiritual Wickedneſſe,</hi> that may rob or ſpoil them of their Proviſion for their Journey. They <hi>goe on</hi> (as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> ſaid of himſelf, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 71.16.) <hi>in the ſtrength of the Lord God. Their Strength is in him, in whoſe Heart are the ways of them: they goe from Strength to Strength,</hi> Pſal. 84.5, 7. <hi>The Joy of the Lord is their Strength;</hi> his Love heartens them: the <hi>Hope</hi> of Glory keeps them from fainting; it is <hi>as an Anchor of the Soul, firm and ſtable, and which entreth into that within the Veil.</hi> They <hi>look unto Jeſus, the Authour and finiſher of their Faith, who for the Joy that was ſet before him, endured the Croſs, and deſpiſed the Shame, and is ſet down at the right hand of God.</hi> They <hi>endure Contradiction of Sinners,</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt unto bloud, ſtriving againſt Sin.</hi> In a word, Faith in God through <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Joy in the Holy Ghoſt, Love to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> Hope of the Inheritance above, animate them to holy Reſolutions of Obedience to God, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm them againſt Difficulties, keep them from fainting under any Preſſures, till they get to the end of their Journey, and that Reſt which is prepared for them that walk uprightly.</p>
               <p n="2">II. <hi>How this Walking of a man in his <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>prightneſs doth demonſtrate the Fear of the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="407" facs="tcp:42122:206"/>
               <p>Such Walking doth evidently demonſtrate the Fear of the Lord (that is, that reverential Regard of God as their Lord and Maſter, the Supreme Law-giver and Judge, to whom they are ſubject) to be the Principle that acts them, and carries them on with vigour to walk in their Uprightneſs. For, 1. In that they ſet their faces towards God, they ſhew that their Walking tends to pleaſe God, to gain his Approbation; which is the greateſt ſign of Fear in a Servant to his Maſter, a Child to his Father, a Subject to his Prince: for in all theſe Relations it is the Reverence of Superiours which moves the Inferiour to put forth his ability for the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour. So it is the Fear of God that moves the upright Walker to <hi>glorifie God in his Body and Spirit, which are God's;</hi> to <hi>preſent his Body to him as a living Sacrifice in his reaſonable Service;</hi> to devote himſelf to God, and to gratifie him with what Offering he hath, with what Performance he is able to doe. 2. A man's Choice of God's Commands, as his Path, ſhews his Subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to him; and that is the greateſt proof of an holy Fear of the Divine Majeſty. He is <hi>a man after God's own heart,</hi> who will <hi>doe all his Will;</hi> as it is ſaid of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> Act. 13.22. Which is the great Scope of him that walks in his Uprightneſs; and conſequently a proof of his owning God's Sovereignty, and uniting of his Heart to fear his Name. 3. A man's Walking in his Uprightneſs proceeds from that Faith whereby the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever preſents God to himſelf, ſets him before his face, <hi>ſees him that is inviſible,</hi> as <hi>Moſes</hi> did, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.27. which begets Fear of God, takes away ſervile Fear of others, keeps him in even and conſtant Obedience; as <hi>Enoch, Noah, Abraham,</hi> and all the Holy Patriarchs, who wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked with and before God without Fear of their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, in the Fear of God, depending on his Protection, and ſubjecting themſelves to his Direction; which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged the Lord to be their God.</p>
               <pb n="408" facs="tcp:42122:207"/>
               <p n="3">III. <hi>What Advantage accrues to him that walketh in his <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>prightneſs, and feareth the Lord.</hi> Of which very briefly.</p>
               <p>The Pſalmiſt tells us in few words, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 84.11. that <hi>the Lord God is a Sun and a Shield: the Lord will give Grace and Glory: no good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly.</hi> Pſal. 97.11. <hi>Light is ſown for the Righteous, and Gladneſs for the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pright in heart.</hi> And after him the Apoſtle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.16. <hi>As many as walk according to the Rule of the new Creature in Chriſt Jeſus, Peace be on them and Mercy, and on the Iſrael of God.</hi> Whence it is rightly inferred, that all ſuch as walk in their Uprightneſs, out of a Fear of the Lord, are aſſured of Light to guide them, Protection to preſerve them, Peace to quiet them, Supply of good things to chear them, Aſſiſtence to help them, Favour to comfort them, and Glory to advance them.</p>

               <p>And now what remains, but that each of us (as the Prophet minds the <hi>Jews,</hi> Hag. 1.5.) <hi>conſider our Ways,</hi> whether we have choſen the Way that leads to Life, or that which is the Path to Deſtruction; whether we walk uprightly in the Fear of God, or perverſly in Compliance with Satan. All of us have a Journey to goe, <hi>here we have no continuing City.</hi> We may ſay as <hi>David,</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.15. <hi>We are Strangers before God, as were all our Fathers: our days on the Earth are as a Shadow, and there is none abiding,</hi> no expectation of a ſettled Manſion here.

               <p>Oh then how much doth it concern us to heed which Way we take? whether the tendence of our Courſe of life be to <hi>walk in our <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>prightneſs,</hi> as thoſe
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:42122:207"/>that <hi>fear the Lord;</hi> or our <hi>Converſation</hi> be <hi>in the Luſts of our Fleſh, fulfilling the deſires of the Fleſh and of the Mind:</hi> whether we devote our ſelves to the Fear of God, ſpend our lives, imploy our time and eſtate to pleaſe him, to doe his Will; or our <hi>Walking be accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the courſe of this World, according to the Prince of the power of the Air, the Spirit that worketh in the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Diſobedience.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If you ſay you fear God, and expect Heaven; you muſt manifeſt it by departing from your ſinfull Ways, by <hi>ſerving him in Holineſs and Righteouſneſs before him all the days of your life.</hi> They muſt walk before God in their Uprightneſs here, who would ſtand before God in Happineſs hereafter. Not Words, but Works, not <hi>a Form of Godlineſs,</hi> but <hi>the Power of it,</hi> prevails with God. <hi>Be not deceived,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, (<hi>Gal.</hi> 6.7, 8.) <hi>God is not mocked: for whatſoever a man ſoweth, that ſhall he reap. For he that ſoweth to his Fleſh, ſhall of the Fleſh reap Corruption: but he that ſoweth to the Spirit, ſhall of the Spirit reap Life everlaſting. Follow</hi> therefore <hi>Holineſs, without which no man ſhall ſee the Lord.</hi> Walk with that Company here, with which you would have your Lot hereafter. Walk not in the way with them, with whom you dread to be aſſociated at laſt. Take heed of Complying with the World in your Life, with whom you would not be condemned at your Death. Conſider the End of your Life; and follow their Faith, whoſe End you would purchaſe at the greateſt rate. Remember the Advice of the Prophet, <hi>Jerem.</hi> 6.16. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, Stand in the ways and ſee, and ask for the old Paths, where is the good Way, and walk there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and ye ſhall find Reſt for your Souls.</hi>

               <p>I direct you not to follow any New Lights, neither to ſeek any new Ways; but I adviſe you to goe to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that you may <hi>find Reſt for your Souls;</hi> to <hi>take

               <p>Concerning this three Quaere's are to be anſwered; like as there were in handling the former Propoſition.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Who is meant by him that is <hi>perverſe in his Ways,</hi> and when a man is ſaid to be ſo. 2. How ſuch an one <hi>deſpiſeth the Lord.</hi> 3. What is the Evil of ſuch Deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Lord. Of which in their order.</p>
               <p n="1">I. <hi>Who is meant by him that is perverſe in his Ways.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="412" facs="tcp:42122:209"/>
               <p>By <hi>Ways</hi> (as hath been already ſaid) are meant the Actions of a Man as he is a Rational Being, whoſe Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſhould be ordered by ſuch a Rule as his Creatour hath made known, and ſhould tend to his Maker's Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. For <hi>God</hi> at firſt <hi>made Man upright,</hi> or <hi>ſimple,</hi> ſo as that he had no other Way but that which was God's: <hi>but they have ſought out many Inventions,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon, Eccles.</hi> 7.29. Whence it comes to paſs, that there are many and various Ways in which men now walk, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to God's Way, that is, his preſcribed Will; which is the Way that every man ſhould walk in, and then he <hi>walketh in his <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>prightneſs.</hi> But when he chuſeth any Invention of his own to direct the Courſe of his Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons by, and chiefly when he oppoſeth God's Will, his Truth, his Precepts, then is he <hi>perverſe in his Ways.</hi> Now this may happen two ways; either out of Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, or wittingly: and this either willingly, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingly; with a pure, or a mixt Will; out of Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, through Fear, Forgetfulneſs, Heedleſneſs, or ſuch like Cauſe as abates much of the Voluntarineſs of the Action; or obſtinately, reſolutely, preſumptuouſly, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Conviction, Warning, Reproof, Correction, not onely actually, but alſo habitually, and incorrigibly, with a high hand and contumacious mind. He that <hi>fears the Lord,</hi> and <hi>walks in his <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>prightneſs,</hi> may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times actually be <hi>perverſe in his Ways</hi> out of Ignorance, Infirmity, through prevalency of Temptation; and yet not be accounted ſo <hi>perverſe in his Ways</hi> as to be ſaid to <hi>deſpiſe the Lord</hi> ſo as <hi>Solomon</hi> here means. S. <hi>Paul</hi> at <hi>Antioch</hi> chargeth S. <hi>Peter</hi> and S. <hi>Barnabas,</hi> that they <hi>did not walk uprightly, according to the Truth of the Goſpel,</hi> Gal. 2.14. becauſe that S. <hi>Peter, before certain came from James, did eat with the Gentiles: but when they were come, he withdrew, and ſeparated himſelf, fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them of the Circumciſion. And the other Jews diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:42122:209"/>likewiſe with him; inſomuch that Barnabas alſo was carried away with their diſſimulation.</hi> Herein was a kind of <hi>Perverſeneſs,</hi> out of ſome Timorouſneſs incident to a holy Saint, and a <hi>Pillar</hi> among the Apoſtles, and that in a Point which ſo much concerned the Truth of the Goſpel: and yet there was no ſuch <hi>deſpiſing of the Lord</hi> as <hi>Solomon</hi> doth here ſtigmatize. Nor dare I ſay but that <hi>David did that which was</hi> not <hi>right in the eyes of the Lord, in the matter of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah the Hittite,</hi> in the buſineſs of <hi>Ziba,</hi> and of Numbring the people; but that he <hi>deſpiſed the Commandment of the Lord, to doe evil in his ſight:</hi> yet was he not ſo perverſe in his Ways as to deſpiſe the Lord ſo as here is meant, becauſe it was not done obſtinately, impenitently, habitually. But <hi>Eli</hi>'s Sons, <hi>Hophni</hi> and <hi>Phinehas,</hi> who cauſed <hi>men to abhor the Offerings of the Lord,</hi> and perſiſted in their Sin, after their Father <hi>Eli</hi>'s Admonition, were obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately, habitually perverſe in their Ways, and deſpiſed the Lord: 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.17, 25, 29. In like manner all ſuch are perverſe in their Ways, and deſpiſe the Lord ſo as <hi>Solomon</hi> here means, who do ſtubbornly and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitently perſiſt in any ſinfull Errour, or wicked Practice againſt the Law of God, or the Goſpel of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> either not relinquiſhing the one after Diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, or not amending the other after Reproof; but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding the one, and continuing in the other, againſt the Warnings of God and Man.</p>
               <p>Of ſuch Perverſeneſs of men in their Ways there are many Degrees, according to the ſeveral kinds of War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings given them, the Frequency of their Actings, the Stifneſs and Stubbornneſs of their Wills, the Procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of their Practices, the Excellency of God's Will which they bend themſelves againſt, and the Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments they have to conform to it.</p>
               <p>Sometimes the Lord warns men of the Evil of their
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:42122:210"/>ways by the Reproof of an Enemy: and it is Wiſedom to make uſe of it for our Amendment. Even <hi>Plutarch</hi> hath a Treatiſe directing a man <hi>How to get good by an Enemie's ill will:</hi> this is to make Mithridate out of Poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Sometimes a Friend ſhews us our Evil: and then it is great Perverſeneſs to perſiſt in it. Sometimes an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thourized Paſtour, a Parent, a Yoke-fellow, admoniſhes with due Correction; and yet perſons continue obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate. Sometimes God ſends Warnings by his Prophets: as he did to the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36.15, 16. He <hi>ſent to them by his Meſſengers, riſing up betimes, and ſending them, becauſe he had Compaſſion on his people: But they mocked the Meſſengers of God, and deſpiſed his words, and miſuſed his Prophets, until the Wrath of the Lord aroſe againſt his people, till there was no Remedy.</hi> Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he warns men by his Judgments, either on them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or on others; expecting that <hi>when his Judgments are in the Earth, the Inhabitants of the world ſhould learn Righteouſneſs,</hi> Iſa. 26.9. Yet though they be ite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, varied, be very conſpicuous and terrible, men <hi>return not to the Lord;</hi> as the Prophet complains, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mos</hi> 4.11. Yea, they are ſo far from being bettered by God's Judgments, that, as it is ſaid <hi>Rev.</hi> 16.11. ſome <hi>blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme the God of Heaven becauſe of their Pains and their Sores, and repent not of their deeds.</hi> Yea, ſo far are God's Judgments or Mercies from turning men from their Sins, that oftentimes they multiply Abominations the more: which ſhews extreme Perverſeneſs. The ſame may be ſaid of them that abuſe God's Patience and <hi>Long-ſuffering, not knowing that the Goodneſs of God ſhould lead them to Repentance;</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.4. And of thoſe that, <hi>becauſe Sentence againſt an evil work is not executed ſpeedily, therefore their Heart is fully ſet in them to doe evil,</hi> Eccles. 8.11.</p>
               <p>And according to this Stifneſs of their Wills, there
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:42122:210"/>are Degrees of Perverſeneſs in their Practices. For ſome (as the Prophet chargeth the <hi>Jews,</hi> Zach. 7.11.) <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to hearken, pull away the Shoulder, ſtop their Ears that they ſhould not hear. Yea,</hi> (ſaith he, verſ. 12.) <hi>they made their Heart as an Adamant-ſtone, leſt they ſhould hear the Lord, and the words which the Lord of hoaſts ſent in his Spirit by the Prophets: therefore a great Wrath came from the Lord of hoaſts.</hi> Some ſhut their Eyes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Light in them by their vicious Affections; darken the Light of their natural Conſcience, and are <hi>given over to a reprobate Senſe.</hi> Many <hi>hold the Truth in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrighteouſneſs,</hi> after it is made known to them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.18. and not onely yield not to it, but alſo wrangle and cavil againſt it. Yea, there are not a few, who, in ſtead of being altered by any Denunciations of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from God, or Convictions of his Law, turn the very Speeches of the Prophets and Preachers that are ſent to them into proverbial Scoffs: as thoſe that ſcornfully ſaid, <hi>Let him make ſpeed, and haſten his Work, that we may ſee it: and let the Counſel of the Holy one of Iſrael draw nigh and come, that we may know it,</hi> Iſa. 5.19. And thoſe that tauntingly took up the Prophet's term of <hi>the Burthen of the Lord,</hi> Jer. 23.38. To what height of profane Impudence, and Perverſeneſs in their Ways, are they come, who (as if they counted it their Brave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry) abuſe the very words of Holy Scripture, even of <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf, in their Diſcourſes and fooliſh Jeſts, (though by themſelves and thoſe like them counted witty,) to make themſelves ſport, and render them ridiculous? who, as if it were a part of Gallantry to provoke the God of Heaven, glory in their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rageous Swearing, and direfull Imprecations againſt themſelves? Others there are like <hi>Elymas</hi> the Sorcerer, whom S. <hi>Paul</hi> (Act. 13.10.) terms a man <hi>full of all Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlety and all Miſchief,</hi> a <hi>Child of the Devil, Enemy of all
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:42122:211"/>Righteouſneſs, who ceaſed not to pervert the right ways of the Lord, in ſeeking to turn away the Deputy, Sergius Paulus, from the Faith of Chriſt.</hi> To whom thoſe are near of kin of whom S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, in his Farewell-Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to the <hi>Epheſians, Act.</hi> 20.29, 30. <hi>I know this, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter my departing, ſhall grievous Wolves enter in amongſt you, not ſparing the Flock. Alſo of your own ſelves ſhall men ariſe, ſpeaking perverſe things, to draw away Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples after them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All which perverſe Proceedings are much aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Oppoſition in them not onely to the Law, but alſo to the Goſpel. For, as <hi>the carnal Mind is En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity againſt God,</hi> in that <hi>it is not ſubject to the Law of God,</hi> Rom. 8.7. ſo it is much greater Perverſeneſs in a man's Ways, to <hi>neglect ſo great Salvation, which at the firſt began to be ſpoken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him; God alſo bearing them witneſs, both with Signs and Wonders, and with divers Miracles, and Gifts of the Holy Ghoſt, according to his own will,</hi> Heb. 2.3, 4. And therefore our Saviour ſaith, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.19. <hi>This is the Condemnation,</hi> (<hi>per Eminentiam,</hi> the great Condemnation,) <hi>that Light is come into the World, and men loved Darkneſs rather then Light, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their deeds were evil.</hi> It is alſo ſo much the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Perverſeneſs, and renders it incurable, unpardonable, for men, after their profeſſion of the Truth, after Vows to God of adhering to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> after they <hi>have been once enlightned, have taſted of the heavenly Gift, and been made partakers of the Holy Ghoſt, have taſted of the good Word of God, and the powers of the World to come,</hi> then to <hi>fall away,</hi> ſo that <hi>they crucifie the Son of God afreſh, and put him to an open ſhame,</hi> Heb. 6.5, 6. This is the moſt contumelious way of <hi>Deſpiſing the Lord,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all the ſorts and degrees of <hi>Perverſeneſs in our Ways;</hi> as may be diſcerned in anſwering the Second Quaere,</p>
               <pb n="417" facs="tcp:42122:211"/>
               <p n="2">II. <hi>How he that is perverſe in his Ways deſpiſeth the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Deſpiſing,</hi> ſaith <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> (in the Second of his Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toricks, in the Chapter of <hi>Anger,</hi>) is the Act of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in not ſhewing any regard of a thing or perſon. And it hath its Effects in divers degrees. Sometimes there is onely <hi>Slighting,</hi> making none or little Eſteem of either. Sometimes <hi>Damnifying,</hi> daring to harm; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is ſo mean a Thought thereof, as not to fear any Revenge. Sometimes there is <hi>inſolent Scorning</hi> thereof, as of no value. And in all theſe degrees a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is deſpiſed, when the Contempt is offered either im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately or directly, as when a King is reviled to his face, his Perſon kicked, ſpurned, derided openly: or mediately, when any ſuch Uſage is ſhewed to that which doth more peculiarly pertain to his Dignity; as when his Image, Coin, Laws, Son, Friends, Servants, Officers, Embaſſadours, are vilified or abuſed. The Contempt of whom though it be firſt terminated on them; yet when it is offered for the King's ſake, out of Enmity to or Diſeſteem of him, or Affront to his Government, the Relation to him being known, it is either actually, or by interpretation, a Deſpiſing of the King himſelf. Now, (as the Prophet <hi>Malachi</hi> hath it, 1.14.) <hi>I am a great King, ſaith the Lord of hoaſts, and my Name is dreadfull among the Heathens.</hi> He <hi>is the true God, the living God, and an everlaſting King,</hi> Jer. 10.10. <hi>There is none like unto him; he is Great, and his Name is great in might,</hi> verſ. 6. According as his <hi>Name</hi> is <hi>glorious and fearfull,</hi> Deut. 28.58. ſo are all the things pertaining to his Eſſence and to his Greatneſs: there is ſome Reverence due to them. And God is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed, not onely when he is diſclaimed, as he was by <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> Exod. 5.2. or not minded, as by thoſe <hi>wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked</hi> ones, who <hi>through the Pride of their countenance
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:42122:212"/>will not ſeek after God, God is not in all their thoughts, Pſal.</hi> 10.4. or when he is reproached and blaſphemed, as he was by <hi>Rabſhakeh,</hi> Iſa. 36.20. or when his Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip is neglected, as it was <hi>Mal.</hi> 1.6, 7. or his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence denied, as when it was asked, <hi>Where is the God of Judgment?</hi> Malach. 2.17. But alſo when his Works are undervalued. <hi>He that mocketh the Poor, reproacheth his Maker,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon,</hi> Prov. 17.5. Specially when his Children are deſpiſed. <hi>He that deſpiſeth, deſpiſeth not Man, but God, who hath alſo given unto us his Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4.8. In like manner, to ſlight God's Laws, his Threatnings, his Judgments, is an high Contempt of God. But God is moſt of all deſpiſed, when the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, the Grace of God in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the Embaſſadours that bring it, the Son of God himſelf, <hi>the Image of the invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible God,</hi> are contemned, and the <hi>Spirit of God deſpighted. He that deſpiſeth you, deſpiſeth me,</hi> ſaith <hi>Chriſt; and he that deſpiſeth me, deſpiſeth him that ſent me,</hi> Luk. 10.16. And in this reſpect he that is perverſe in his Ways de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſeth the Lord, becauſe he deſpiſeth God's Commands, his Goſpel, his Meſſengers; but moſt of all, his <hi>Son, in whom he is well pleaſed,</hi> and his <hi>Spirit of Grace,</hi> the chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt of all the Gifts that he communicates unto men. Whence may be diſcerned</p>
               <p n="3">III. <hi>What is the Evil of ſuch Deſpiſing of the Lord.</hi> Of which in a word.</p>
               <p>All Indignities offered to a King are high Miſdemea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours: to rebell againſt his Crown, to ſpeak evil of his Perſon, are <hi>Crimina laeſae Majeſtatis,</hi> amount to High Treaſon, and are uſually avenged by the moſt ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and tormenting Death. Doubtleſs the Perverſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Spirit who is obſtinate in his Ways, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſeth God's Statutes and his Judgments, is no leſs High Treaſon againſt the Heavenly Majeſty, his Crown and Dignity; chiefly when his Grace is rejected, his <hi>Son</hi>
                  <pb n="419" facs="tcp:42122:212"/>is not <hi>kiſſed,</hi> his <hi>Spirit</hi> is <hi>deſpighted:</hi> there being no greater Affront to him, who is <hi>the bleſſed and onely Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentate, King of Kings, and Lord of Lords,</hi> then when his Grace in <hi>Chriſt</hi> is rejected, when men <hi>will not have Chriſt to rule over them,</hi> but prefer <hi>the Prince of this World</hi> before <hi>the Lord of Glory, the Prince of Life;</hi> and in ſtead of welcoming the Spirit of Life, embrace the accurſed Fiend, the Authour of Death. This makes the Wrath of God hot, ſo that <hi>they periſh from the way, when his Wrath is kindled but a little,</hi> Pſal. 2.12. Such men <hi>make God a Liar,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.10. And that doth in effect un-God him, and dethrone him. By <hi>deſpiſing the Riches of his Goodneſs, after their impenitent hard Heart, they treaſure up to themſelves Wrath againſt the day of Wrath, and revelation of the righteous Judgment of God,</hi> Rom. 2.4, 5. Which can be no leſs then <hi>fiery Indignation, which ſhall devour the Adverſaries, who tread under foot</hi> the Bloud of <hi>the Son of God, count the Bloud of the Covenant, wherewith</hi> perſons <hi>are ſanctified, an unholy thing, and doe deſpight to the Spirit of Grace, Heb.</hi> 10.27, 29.</p>

            <p>YOU have here exhibited to your view the moſt happy and glorious Spectacle which humane ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits are capable of. Brave Shows (as at Princes Coronations and Marriages) do greatly attract the Eyes of men. One of the ancient Fathers wiſhed much to ſee a <hi>Roman</hi> Triumph in its greateſt Glory. The Queen of <hi>Sheba</hi> was ſo affected with the Glory of <hi>Solomon</hi> and his Court, that ſhe took a great and coſtly Journey to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold them; and was ſo tranſported with what ſhe ſaw and heard, that <hi>there was no more Spirit in her.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I may well ſay, <hi>A Greater then Solomon,</hi> a bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Sight then <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Court, or a <hi>Roman</hi> Triumph, <hi>is here.</hi> Here is the God of Glory on his Throne. Here
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:42122:214"/>the Court of glorious <hi>Spirits which are made perfect,</hi> have their moſt ſplendid Robes on, and the Enſign of their Victory in their hands: that <hi>Palma nobilis</hi> which car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to God the Offscouring of the Earth; and makes them, that hid themſelves in Dens and Caves of the Earth, to be advanced to the Habitation of God in the higheſt Heavens.</p>
            <p>And therefore this Show is worth your beholding: which I ſhall endeavour to preſent to you, though not in its Splendour, yet ſo as I hope it may raiſe you up, as to an Admiration and Extolling of the Divine Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency, ſo alſo to an Imitation of and a Following after thoſe glorious Saints, of whom it is ſaid in the Verſe before my Text, that they <hi>came out of great Tribulation, and waſhed their Robes and made them white in the Bloud of the Lamb:</hi> and in this Verſe, <hi>Therefore are they before the Throne of God, and ſerve him day and night in his Temple; and he that ſitteth on the Throne ſhall dwell among them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In which two Verſes you have deſcribed,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Exploits and Eſtate of theſe noble Warriours or Combatants on Earth. They had a great Fight of Afflictions: They <hi>wraſtled not</hi> onely <hi>againſt Fleſh and Bloud; but againſt Principalities and Powers, againſt the Rulers of the Darkneſs of this world, againſt Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Wickedneſs in high,</hi> or <hi>heavenly, places:</hi> And though they had ſore Falls, yet <hi>they waſhed their Robes and made them white in the Bloud of the Lamb;</hi> and <hi>by the word of their Teſtimony</hi> at laſt <hi>they overcame Satan,</hi> and the World, <hi>not loving their Lives unto the death.</hi> This was their gallant <hi>Fight of Faith;</hi> this their glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Victory over their proud and moſt treacherous E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Their Triumph, their Aſcent into the Capitol, their Reception into Heaven: <hi>They are before the
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:42122:214"/>Throne of God, and ſerve him day and night in his Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and he that ſitteth on the Throne ſhall dwell among them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Their preſent State there may be ſeen in theſe Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In the place where they are, they do not, as they did on Earth, <hi>wander about in Deſarts and Mountains, and in Dens and Caves of the earth;</hi> but are <hi>about the Throne of God.</hi> Nor are they cloathed with <hi>Sheep-skins and Goat-skins;</hi> but have Royal or Prieſtly Robes, like the Servants of <hi>Solomon</hi> about his Throne, or the Prieſts in their Garments at the Altar or in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Their Imployment is not to grind in Mills, or make Brick under a cruel <hi>Pharaoh:</hi> but, like the Prieſts and <hi>Levites</hi> at the Temple, <hi>they day and night ſerve</hi> the Great, the Glorious and <hi>Bleſſed Potentate, who is King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, who onely hath Immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi> and <hi>dwelleth in Light incomprehenſible.</hi> And their Service is the moſt pleaſant, and without any Tediouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to wit, to praiſe and magnifie him everlaſtingly.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Their Company is not baſe, ſordid and vexing Men; or malicious and cruel Devils: but <hi>he that ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth on the Throne, the King of Glory,</hi> who hath all Beauty and Lovelineſs; who will <hi>dwell among them,</hi> ſo as to protect them, and ſatisfie them with his Preſence.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not have time to inſiſt upon the deſcription of the Conflict and Atchievement of theſe Bleſſed Saints when upon Earth: though the particle <hi>[Therefore,]</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring thither, might induce me to conſider thereof. Nor is it neceſſary to inquire into the Time of that great Affliction which theſe are ſaid to come out of. I will (without limitation of it to one ſort of Saints, as Martyrs, at one time, whether in the Ten firſt great Perſecutions under the Pagan <hi>Roman</hi> Emperours, or
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:42122:215"/>thoſe under the bloudy <hi>Roman</hi> Popes by Burnings and moſt cruel Maſſacres) apply this to all Saints; and thence obſerve,

                  <item>1. <hi>That Afflictions, Perſecutions, yea Death, do not extinguiſh the Being of Saints, who waſh their Robes and make them clean in the Bloud of the Lamb.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. <hi>That when they are removed from Men below, they are placed before the Throne of God.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>3. <hi>That there they ſerve God in his Temple in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven perpetually.</hi>

                  <item>4. <hi>That they have God everlaſtingly cohabiting with them.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>It is the ſaying of our Lord to <hi>Martha,</hi> Joh. 11.26. <hi>Whoſoever liveth, and believeth in me, ſhall never die.</hi> It is true, that believing <hi>Lazarus,</hi> her Brother, was then in the Grave, and had been dead (to her apprehenſion) four days, inſomuch that ſhe made no other account of him but as of a putrefied ſtinking Carkaſe: yet even then <hi>Chriſt</hi> avoucheth him to have been alive. And in like manner he judged <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> though buried many Ages before, yet even then when he converſed on Earth to be alive, and ſo to continue for ever. God being <hi>their God,</hi> and he <hi>not being a God of the dead, but of the living,</hi> they muſt by conſequence live unto him: <hi>Luk.</hi> 20.38.</p>
               <p>Be the Diſſolution of the Bodies from the Souls of the Saints never ſo violent, their Fleſh and Bones never ſo much conſumed by the moſt vehement Flames, torn
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:42122:215"/>and devoured by the moſt greedy and ravenous Beaſts, be they never ſo much putrefied and waſted with Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; yet in their Duſt and Aſhes there is a Seed of Life. It is with their Reliques as it is with Seed that is ſown, which though it be buried under the clods of the Earth, and in appearance to men annihilated; yet hath it a ſeminal Life, which ſhall ſpring up again and flouriſh. This <hi>Job</hi> was aſſured of, when he ſaid, <hi>Job</hi> 19.26, 27. <hi>Though after my Skin, Worms deſtroy this Body, yet in my Fleſh ſhall I ſee God: Whom I ſhall ſee for my ſelf, and mine Eyes ſhall behold, and not another; though my Reins be conſumed within me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But this is not all: The Spirits of men, even when their Bodies have onely a ſeminal Life, have an actual Life; they have a Life of Senſe and Underſtanding: they neither have their Life extinguiſhed, nor laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleep without Feeling or Cogitation. Though <hi>the Duſt return to the Earth as it was,</hi> yet <hi>the Spirit returns to God that gave it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Spirits that were ſometimes diſobedient, when once the Long-ſuffering of God waited in the days of Noah, while the Ark was preparing,</hi> were <hi>in priſon</hi> when S. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> wrote: 1 Epiſt. 3.19, 20. And it is the ſaying of the Authour to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> Chap. 12.23. <hi>Ye are come to the Spirits of Juſt men made perfect.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When <hi>Lazarus</hi> was raiſed from the Grave, he had not a new Soul created which was not exiſtent before, but the ſame Soul brought back into his Body. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at the Reſurrection are other Souls joyned to the Bodies, then thoſe that before had lived in them. For otherwiſe, not the ſame Soul which had done good or evil ſhould be rewarded, but another. When (<hi>Act.</hi> 7.59.) S. <hi>Stephen called upon God, and ſaid, Lord Jeſus, receive my Spirit,</hi> he, being full of the Holy Ghoſt, was aſſured, that though his Body were buried, yet his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:42122:216"/>ſhould be with <hi>Chriſt.</hi> And when the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> expreſſed his <hi>willingneſs to be abſent from the Body;</hi> yet his expectation was, <hi>to be preſent with the Lord,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.8. It was his choice and option, <hi>to depart, and to be with Chriſt,</hi> as being <hi>far better,</hi> Phil. 1.23. He had learned, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> was in Death Life, that <hi>he that believeth on him hath everlaſting Life,</hi> that <hi>his Life was hid with Chriſt in God,</hi> that <hi>the Spirit of God that dwelt in him was Life, becauſe of Righteouſneſs;</hi> and therefore he counted not <hi>himſelf to live, but Chriſt in him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as <hi>Chriſt</hi> did commend his Spirit into the hands of his Father, when he gave up the ghoſt, being aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red he ſhould be in Paradiſe: ſo doe all the Saints that have the Spirit of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> even when they lie down in their beds of Earth, they yield up their Spirits into the hands of their Father, as aſſured to be with <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who is <hi>the Way</hi> to the Father.

                  <hi>That the Saints ſerve God in his Temple in Heaven perpetually.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Service of a great and gracious Prince, though but in the meaneſt Office about him, is an Employment much ſought after, for the Advantages it brings of Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, free Acceſs, Eſteem, and other Privileges concomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant: but to attend him in a higher quality is ſtill more deſirable, for the Dignity and Nearneſs of it to ſuch a Majeſty. <hi>David</hi> choſe <hi>rather to be a Door-keeper in the Houſe of God,</hi> then to be as <hi>Haman,</hi> the great Favourite in the Palace of <hi>Shuſhan</hi> with <hi>Ahaſuerus</hi> King of <hi>Perſia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet theſe are but petty and low Advantages in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of what accrue by the Service of the Great God, who <hi>filleth Heaven and Earth.</hi> Surely it was a Happineſs to be a Servant to God, though but <hi>a Hew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of wood,</hi> or <hi>a Drawer of water, for the Houſe of God,</hi> as the <hi>Gibeonites</hi> were: they were yet far more <hi>bleſſed</hi> that <hi>dwelt in his Houſe,</hi> as Prieſts and <hi>Levites,</hi> to miniſter before him, and to ſerve at his Altar: but it is ſuperlative Happineſs to ſerve God in his Temple in Heaven, and to doe this for ever without any intermiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; eſpecially when the Service is no other then Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of Gratitude, and Praiſing of the Great Creatour and Benefactour of the world, even him who is <hi>Optimus</hi>
                  <pb n="429" facs="tcp:42122:217"/>as well as <hi>Maximus,</hi> the Beſt of Beings as well as the Greateſt; even him who is <hi>the Father of Lights, from whom every good and perfect Gift cometh, in whom is no Variableneſs, nor ſhadow of turning.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They that <hi>are ſtill praiſing God</hi> on Earth are <hi>bleſſed, Pſal.</hi> 84.4. As <hi>all God's Works do praiſe the Lord;</hi> ſo <hi>his Saints do bleſs him: they ſhew forth the Glory of his Kingdom, and talk of his Power,</hi> Pſalm 145.10, 11. Much more joyous and bleſſed a thing is it when the great Conſort of Heaven do there perpetually ſound forth the high Praiſes of their God; where they have nothing elſe to doe but to ſing, <hi>Bleſſing, and Honour, and Glory, and Power be unto him that ſitteth upon the Throne, and unto the Lamb, for ever and ever;</hi> where this <hi>New Song</hi> is ſung with the beſt Muſick of Heaven, concerning the Lord <hi>Jeſus, Thou art worthy</hi> of all Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, <hi>for thou waſt ſlain, and haſt redeemed us to God by thy Bloud, out of every kindred, and tongue, and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and nation; and haſt made us unto our God Kings and Prieſts;</hi> and where with a loud voice, with the greateſt Shout of Angels and glorified Saints, this Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment is echoed forth, <hi>Worthy is the Lamb that was ſlain, to receive Power, and Riches, and Wiſedom, and Strength, and Honour, and Glory, and Bleſſing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Oh how glad are men to tell of the Good they have received by ſuch and ſuch Benefactours? If a gracious Prince hath but admitted them to kiſs his Hands, hath deigned to ſpeak kindly to them, to promiſe them Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment at Court; how do men, like <hi>Haman,</hi> tell their Wives and Friends of it with rejoycing? how highly do they eſteem themſelves? what Regard do they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect from others? how do they pleaſe themſelves in the expectation of his Performance? how thankfully do they receive any Intelligence of him, any Meſſage from him? And yet it often falls out, that Princes Favourites
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:42122:218"/>be, as a wiſe Heathen ſaid, like Counters; which one day ſtand for pounds, another day are of no value. So that, perhaps, whom they magnified to day, him they will curſe to morrow: whom they gloried in one day, him they are diſpleaſed at the next.</p>
               <p>It is otherwiſe with the Saints in Heaven then with Courtiers on Earth. Once in God's Favour, and they never loſe it. They have no fear of Frowns, when once before him in his Temple; they have no occaſion of Diſlike at any of his Looks or Speeches. There is all Serenity of Aſpect, Entertainment with perfect Friendſhip, matter of eternal Love, everlaſting Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>And therefore with the greateſt Freeneſs and Chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, without Intermiſſion or Wearineſs, the Saints do ſerve God in their Hymns in Heaven, and that in his Preſence; for he that ſitteth on the Throne doth dwell among them. Which was my laſt Obſervation, and is now to be conſidered, as the Top of all their Happineſs, ſecuring it from all Loſs, Diſturbance, or Diminution.</p>

                  <hi>That the Saints have God everlaſtingly cohabiting with them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Among the Promiſes and Preferments which are by God beſtowed on his Servants, this is the chiefeſt, That as they are his <hi>Jewells, a peculiar people</hi> to him; are <hi>as lively Stones built up a ſpiritual Houſe, an holy Prieſthood, to offer up ſpiritual Sacrifices acceptable to him by Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> ſo they become <hi>the Temple of the living God; as God hath ſaid, I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they ſhall be my People,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.16.</p>
               <pb n="431" facs="tcp:42122:218"/>
               <p>The Preſence of God is counted ſo neceſſary to his People, that <hi>Moſes</hi> had rather ſtay in the <hi>vaſt howling Wilderneſs,</hi> among fiery ſtinging Serpents, then goe onward toward <hi>Canaan</hi> without it, <hi>Exod.</hi> 33.15. On the other ſide, the Pſalmiſt profeſſeth, that <hi>though he walked through the valley of the ſhadow of death, he would fear no evill;</hi> becauſe <hi>God was with him, his Rod and his Staff did comfort him,</hi> Pſal. 23.4.</p>
               <p>And indeed the chiefeſt Joy of Chriſtians, as well as Safety, is in God's Company. When God <hi>hides his Face,</hi> the holieſt Souls <hi>are troubled:</hi> Satan affrights them, the men of the World vex them; their own Conſciences bring their Sins to remembrance, and cauſe Gripings and Pain in their very Bowells. But when God returns, when all the Clouds and Storms are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed; <hi>Bleſſed,</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt, <hi>is the people that know the joyfull ſound: they ſhall walk, O Lord, in the light of thy Countenance,</hi> Pſal. 89.15.</p>
               <p>How much do Holy Saints here diſquiet themſelves by reaſon of their Cohabitation with profane and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous perſons? When they are forced to dwell with them that are Enemies, they are <hi>as a Sword in their bones,</hi> when <hi>reproachfully they ſay daily to them, Where is thy God?</hi> How do they long for the Chriſtian Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of ſincere Believers and heavenly-minded Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans? But their chief Prayer is, <hi>Lord, lift up the Light of thy Countenance upon us.</hi> Their <hi>Soul thirſteth for God, for the living God: When ſhall we come and appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God?</hi> A wiſe and ſingle-hearted Companion is juſtly valued as a moſt precious Jewell: As <hi>Ointment and Perfume rejoyce the Heart,</hi> ſo doth ſuch Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance a man's Spirit.</p>
               <p>But the beſt of men are imperfect, the pureſt Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches have their Spots, <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s own Diſciples had a <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> with them. They are not quite free from Satan's
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:42122:219"/>Haunts, till they be where <hi>Chriſt</hi> is. But when they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold his Glory, are in the Company of the Lamb, where he is, are in the Houſe where their Father in Heaven dwells, have him dwelling with them, ſo as that they behold his Face, and are in his Hand; then they are filled with everlaſting Joy, abundantly ſatisfied with <hi>the Bread of Life, drink of the River of his Pleaſures, with whom is the Fountain of Life,</hi> and <hi>in his Light they ſee Light:</hi> they find <hi>in God's Preſence there is Fulneſs of Joy, and at his right hand Pleaſures for evermore.</hi>

               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Concerning the Firſt; It is agreed on by moſt, that <hi>the Day of Chriſt</hi> here is meant of his Advent, or Coming in the Fleſh, which we at preſent celebrate. Though ſome refer it more ſpecially to his Paſſion or Suffering. But the <hi>Jews</hi> underſtood it of his Birth, and the Space of his Life on Earth, which uſually is termed <hi>a Man's Day</hi> in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> expreſſion; and in reſpect of <hi>Chriſt, the Days of his fleſh,</hi> Heb. 5.7.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As for the Second; He terms <hi>Abraham their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> as they gloried, by way of Conceſſion, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging them, verſ. 37. to be <hi>Abraham's Seed</hi> by natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Generation: But yet he denies them to be <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s Seed in reſpect of their Minds and Spirits; there being ſo great a Diſſimilitude and Contrariety betwixt them and him therein, that they were more truly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten of the Devil, whom in Lying and Cruelty they ſo much reſembled.</p>
            <pb n="437" facs="tcp:42122:221"/>
            <p n="3">3. As for the Third; The word rendred <hi>[Rejoycing]</hi> ſignifies ſuch a Joy as is accompanied with Leaping or other Geſticulation, as when a man is ſuperlatively affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with a thing which he hopes for, hath ſome tidings and aſſurance of its futurity, and apprehends it as a Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude.</p>
            <p>And it is conceived <hi>Abraham</hi> thus rejoyced, when, upon God's Promiſe of <hi>Sarah</hi>'s Conception, and the Bleſſing conſequent thereupon, (wherein <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming was included,) he <hi>fell upon his face, and laughed, and ſaid in his heart, Shall a Child be born unto him that is an hundred years old? and ſhall Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear?</hi> Which was ſpoken by him, not <hi>dubitativè,</hi> by way of Doubting, (for the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is aſſerted <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.16, 17, 18, 19, 20.) but out of Admiration, as over-joyed at the news.</p>
            <p>So it is ſaid of <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> in the Womb, that at the preſence of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Mother, and her Salutation, <hi>the Babe leaped,</hi> or <hi>skipped in exultation,</hi> for Joy, <hi>in the Womb</hi> of his Mother.</p>
            <p n="4">4. As for the Fourth Quaere; It is true, there be that underſtand the <hi>Seeing</hi> of <hi>Abraham,</hi> of his beholding of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> when with two Angels he appeared to <hi>Abraham</hi> in a Humane ſhape; and <hi>Abraham</hi> ſaw him eat, and talked with him, as with <hi>the Judge of all the Earth:</hi> which was conſequent upon the deſire he had to ſee him, after the Revelation made to him <hi>Gen.</hi> 12.2, 3. and <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.5. and his Exultation thereupon, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.16, 17. Which is far more likely to be meant, then his ſeeing him in the Type of <hi>Iſaac</hi> to be offered, or a Manifeſtation of the time of his Coming to <hi>Abraham</hi> being dead.</p>
            <p>But if the ſenſe be of Intellectual <hi>Seeing,</hi> it may be underſtood of a Seeing by Revelation or Viſion; by ſuch an Apparition as might be peculiar to <hi>Abraham,</hi>
               <pb n="438" facs="tcp:42122:222"/>and not common to thoſe <hi>many Prophets, Kings, and Righteous men,</hi> to whom it was denied <hi>to ſee thoſe things which</hi> the Apoſtles <hi>ſaw, and to hear thoſe things which</hi> they <hi>heard,</hi> Matth. 13.17. <hi>Luk.</hi> 10.24.</p>
            <p>Sure, as <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Faith was ſingular, (whereupon he had the denomination of <hi>the Father of Believers;</hi>) ſo the Manifeſtation of <hi>Chriſt</hi> to him, what-ever it was, had a Peculiarity in reſpect of Prophets, Kings, and Righteous men. And therefore both in <hi>Mary's Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificat,</hi> and in <hi>Zachary's Benedictus, the Performance</hi> of God's <hi>Promiſe</hi> is ſaid to be, <hi>as he ſpake to Abraham,</hi> and, according to <hi>the Oath which he ſware to our Father Abraham.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. As for the Laſt; This Seeing of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Day, (whether it were Ocular or Intellectual,) proper to <hi>Abraham,</hi> was matter of great Joy to <hi>Abraham</hi> in a more eminent manner then to others: both in that he ſaw that Seed which was in ſpecial manner his, not onely becauſe it deſcended from him, (for ſo it was alſo <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>'s Seed,) but becauſe it was to come of <hi>Sarah</hi> in a ſupernatural way; and alſo that <hi>in this Seed,</hi> and ſo in him, <hi>all the Nations of the Earth ſhould be bleſſed,</hi> and <hi>he</hi> himſelf <hi>ſhould be a Bleſſing,</hi> Gen. 12.2. Which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore produced (if not for the kind, yet for the degree,) a ſingular Rejoycing in <hi>Abraham:</hi> ſuch as ſhewed it ſelf, not onely in ſo ready a following God whither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he called him; (a free choice of ſuch an Eſtate of being as God allotted him;) but alſo in that unpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel'd Offering up <hi>Iſaac,</hi> when he was tried, the great effect of his Faith, as it is determined to have been, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.17, 18, 19.</p>
            <p>Having thus opened the Meaning of this Speech of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that I may accommodate it to this preſent Time and Occaſion, of celebrating the Memorial of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Advent, we may hence obſerve,

               <p>And indeed, that there ſhould be a Day of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> was made known to <hi>Simeon,</hi> to whom <hi>it was revealed by the Holy Ghoſt, that he ſhould not ſee Death, before

               <p>As the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> foretold, that <hi>there ſhould come forth a Rod out of the Stem of Jeſſe, and a Branch ſhould grow out of his Roots,</hi> Iſa. 11.1. and the Prophet <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cah,</hi> Mic. 5.2. that the <hi>Meſſiah, who was to be Ruler in Iſrael, ſhould come forth of Bethlehem, whoſe Goings forth had been from of old, from everlaſting:</hi> So it was confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly expected even by the chief Prieſts and Scribes of the people.

                  <hi>That the Certainty of the coming of Chriſt's Day was the Spring of Joy, the Baſis of Comfort, the Stay and Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of their Spirits to Believers of old, in the days of their Pilgrimage on Earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="442" facs="tcp:42122:224"/>
               <p>For this we have the words of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> Act. 2.25, 26, 30. That <hi>David (being a Prophet, and knowing that God had ſworn with an Oath to him, that of the fruit of his Loins, according to the fleſh, he would raiſe up Chriſt, to ſit on his Throne,) ſpake concerning Chriſt,</hi> that <hi>therefore did his Heart rejoyce, and his Tongue was glad, and his Fleſh did reſt in hope.</hi> And <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.26. it is ſaid, that <hi>by Faith Moſes eſteemed the Reproach of Chriſt greater Riches then the Treaſures in Egypt.</hi> And of <hi>Simeon</hi> it is ſaid, that he <hi>waited for</hi> his coming in the Fleſh, as <hi>the Conſolation of Iſrael:</hi> and accordingly, when he had ſeen him, <hi>he took him up in his Arms, and bleſſed God, and ſaid</hi> his <hi>Nunc dimittis, Lord, now letteſt thou thy Servant depart in peace, according to thy word; for mine eyes have ſeen thy Salvation,</hi> Luk. 2.25, 28, 29, 30.</p>
               <p>And conformable to theſe was alſo the frame of Spirit in all the Holy Believers when he appeared in the Fleſh. As perſons over-joyed, they were in a Rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Comfort; ſo as that they could not contain themſelves, but muſt break out into holy Hymns of Praiſe. <hi>My Soul doth magnifie the Lord,</hi> (ſaid his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,) <hi>and my Spirit hath rejoyced in God my Saviour: For he hath regarded the low eſtate of his Handmaiden.</hi> And, <hi>Bleſſed be the Lord God of Iſrael,</hi> (ſaid <hi>Zacharias,</hi>) <hi>for he hath viſited and redeemed his People; and hath raiſed up an Horn of Salvation for us in the Houſe of his Servant David.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>When</hi> the Wiſe men of the Eaſt <hi>ſaw his Star, they rejoyced with exceeding great Joy,</hi> Matth. 2.10. And when the Angel had told the Shepherds, that he <hi>brought them good Tidings of great Joy which ſhould be to all People,</hi> of the <hi>Birth</hi> of <hi>Chriſt, in the City of David;</hi> (upon which <hi>there were with the Angel ſuddenly a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of the Heavenly Hoaſt praiſing God, and ſaying, Glory be to God in the higheſt, and on Earth Peace, Good
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:42122:224"/>will towards men;</hi>) the Shepherds in haſt went to view <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the Manger, and upon their <hi>Return glorified and praiſed God. Hallelujahs</hi> were then the Exerciſe of all that knew of his Birth: and ſo they were of all the Holy Patriarchs and Prophets, when they did by Divine Revelation foreſee, and by Faith wait for his Coming.</p>
               <p>And the ſame ſpirit of Joy ſhewed it ſelf after in all thoſe that ſaw his Day, either with their bodily Eyes, or by the Eye of Faith.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Andrew</hi> finds <hi>Peter,</hi> as over-joyed, he tells him, <hi>We have found the Meſſiah, which is, being inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted, the Chriſt.</hi> When <hi>Philip</hi> finds <hi>Nathanael,</hi> he is in the ſame tune, <hi>We have found him of whom Moſes in the Law, and the Prophets did write, Jeſus of Nazareth, the Son of Joſeph,</hi> Joh. 1.41, 45.</p>
               <p>And of ſucceeding Believers S. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.8. <hi>Whom having not ſeen, ye love; in whom, though now ye ſee him not, yet believing, ye rejoyce with Joy unſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable and full of Glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that I may, by an Induction of Particulars, rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Obſervation from the <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> to the <hi>Theſis,</hi> conclude univerſally, <hi>That the Day of Chriſt is to all Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers the Spring of their Joy, the Baſis of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, the Stay and Support of their Spirits, in the days of their Pilgrimage upon Earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Reaſons whereof are common to all Believers. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is <hi>the ſame yeſterday, and to day, and for ever.</hi> Though <hi>the Myſtery</hi> of the Goſpell was not ſo clearly nor ſo fully revealed before, as it was by the Apoſtles Preaching, but <hi>from the beginning of the world was</hi> in a ſort <hi>hid in God:</hi> yet in no Age <hi>was there Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation in any other, none other Name under Heaven gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven among men whereby they muſt be ſaved.</hi> He onely hath been <hi>the Way, the Truth, and the Life:</hi> ſo that
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:42122:225"/>
                  <hi>none come to the Father but by him. Abel, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Moſes, David,</hi> and all the reſt of the Holy Saints in foregoing Generations, had Salvation by Faith in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as really as S. <hi>Peter</hi> and S. <hi>Paul,</hi> or any of the Holy Martyrs and Confeſſours in the Catholick Church.</p>
               <p>It is true, the Knowledge of <hi>Chriſt</hi> was not ſo clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly revealed to the ſons of men before his Coming in the Fleſh, as it was after, when <hi>the Day-ſpring from on high viſited us, to give Light to them that ſit in Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and in the Shadow of Death, to guide our feet into the way of Peace.</hi> And therefore <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded all the Prophets foregoing, he being the man that could ſay, <hi>Behold the Lamb of God that taketh away the Sins of the World.</hi> Yet the Apoſtles, yea <hi>the leaſt in the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> that can preach <hi>Chriſt</hi> Born, Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, Preaching, Dying, Riſing, Aſcended into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, <hi>is greater then John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> as having <hi>ſeen and heard that which many Prophets and Kings deſired to hear and ſee, but did not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Knowledge the Patriarchs had was Veſpertine: the Apoſtles and ours, comparatively, Meridian.</p>
               <p>Beſides, before <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Aſcenſion, the Knowledge of him was not ſo amply revealed: for though a few of the Gentiles found <hi>Chriſt;</hi> yet the Way of <hi>Salvation</hi> was not <hi>prepared before the face of all People,</hi> ſo as that <hi>Chriſt</hi> became <hi>a Light to lighten the Gentiles,</hi> as well as to be <hi>the Glory of his people Iſrael.</hi> But when S. <hi>Paul</hi> was made the <hi>Apoſtle of the Gentiles, Chriſt</hi> was <hi>ſet to be a Light to the Gentiles, that he might be for Salvation unto the ends of the Earth,</hi> Act. 13.47.</p>
               <p>S. <hi>Peter</hi> was taught to <hi>call none common or unclean,</hi> but to preach to the Gentiles, as being thoſe <hi>to whom alſo God had granted Repentance unto Lefe,</hi> Act. 11.18. Whence the ſame way of Salvation was vouchſafed to <hi>Cornelius</hi> that was to <hi>Abraham: Cornelius</hi> had his <hi>Faith
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:42122:225"/>imputed to him for Righteouſneſs,</hi> as well as <hi>Abraham. God put no difference between them and us,</hi> having <hi>puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied their Hearts by Faith,</hi> ſaith S. <hi>Peter,</hi> Act. 15.9. <hi>He was the God</hi> not <hi>onely of the Jews,</hi> but <hi>alſo of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles: ſeeing it was one God which ſhould juſtifie the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion by Faith, and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncircumciſion through Faith, Rom.</hi> 3.29, 30.</p>
               <p>And hence, as <hi>Abraham rejoyced to ſee Chriſt's Day,</hi> ſo did the Wiſe men of the Eaſt: and in all that were made Holy Converts by the preaching of the Goſpel, there was the ſame Joy, for the kind, which was in <hi>Abraham;</hi> all with the ſame Spirit of Faith glorified <hi>Chriſt,</hi> though ſome with more enlarged Hearts then others. In the Effects of this Joy, Praiſing God, Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and Adhering to him, there is the ſame Mind in all, the ſame Hope, the ſame Expreſſions; though not to the ſame degree in all. In ſome Ages the Joy was more extenſive then in others; in ſome Perſons more intenſive then in others: yet in all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in <hi>Chriſt</hi> it was and is bottomed upon the ſame Ground; a Fruit of the ſame Faith, ſhewing it ſelf by the ſame Expreſſions of Thankſgiving and Love, Prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing God, Following <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and Loving all his Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. So that we may ſay, All <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Children by Faith <hi>rejoyce to ſee Chriſt's Day;</hi> they <hi>ſee it, and are glad.</hi> And thus my Text comes home to you all.</p>

            <p>Some kind of glorious Apparition there was then, when God gave <hi>Abraham</hi> this Mandate. The Buſineſs, no doubt, being (as in After-ages, ſo in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s days) moſt famous, God would have it begun by an illuſtrious Manifeſtation of himſelf, that he might be known to be the God of Glory; and all the Gods that <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Fathers ſerved, to be but Vanities and Lies; not <hi>Numina,</hi> but <hi>Nomina,</hi> not Gods, though ſo called. And that there might be the firmer Impreſſion on <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> thereby, God thus ſhews himſelf, and ſpeaks.</p>
            <p>However God ſpeaks to us, we are to hearken: be it in a Dream, or by a Prophet, if it be God's Voice, it muſt be obeyed. But then moſt heed is to be taken, when God makes known his Pleaſure in an illuſtrious Apparition.</p>
            <p>This Command to <hi>Abraham</hi> was, doubtleſs, of very great Concernment, both to God's own Glory, and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi>'s and all Believers Advantage. And therefore it is of no ſmall importance for us to conſider the Charge which God here gives to <hi>Abraham, Get thee out of thy Country, and from thy Kindred, and from thy Father's Houſe, unto a Land that I ſhall ſhew thee.</hi> Wherein we have,
<list>
                  <item>1. A Journey or Motion commanded him, <hi>Get thee,</hi> or, <hi>Goe thou.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. The <hi>Terminus à quo</hi> of this Motion, or the Place whence he was to goe, <hi>Out of thy Country,</hi> &amp;c.</item>
                  <item>3. The <hi>Terminus ad quem,</hi> or the Place whither he was to goe, <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto a Land that I ſhall ſhew thee.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. The Journy or Motion which is here injoyned <hi>Abraham</hi> is a Tranſmigration, expreſſed thus in the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew,
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:42122:228"/>Lec Leca,</hi> as if it were, <hi>Vade tibi, Goe thou,</hi> or, <hi>Goe to thy ſelf:</hi> which is by ſome conceived a Pleonaſm or Redundance of ſpeech; by others Emphatical, as if it were ſaid, <hi>Goe for thy ſelf,</hi> or thine own Benefit, inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating, that himſelf was the <hi>Finis cui,</hi> he for whom or whoſe ſake that Pilgrimage was injoyned.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>Terminus à quo</hi> of this Motion is threefold.</p>
            <p>Firſt, From his <hi>Country.</hi> Every man's own Country, where he was born, is likely very deſirable to him. That <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes,</hi> whom the Poet ſets out as a great Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller,
<q>(Multorum Mores hominum cognovit &amp; <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbes,)</q> preferred his own <hi>Ithaca</hi> before all the places he had been in, and longed much to ſee the Smoak aſcending from that little Iſland.</p>
            <p>And therefore it might ſeem to <hi>Abraham</hi> (if he had not been guided by a Principle above Nature) an intolerable Injunction, and ſuch as he might have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of with thoſe who bemoaned their Condition thus,</p>
            <q>Nos Patriae fines, nos dulcia linquimus Arva.</q>
            <p>Which was yet farther aggravated, in that <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>r</hi> of the <hi>Chaldees,</hi> or <hi>Meſopotamia,</hi> was no doubt a pleaſant Country, ſituated (as it is conceived by the Deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.14.) in or near the Garden of <hi>Eden:</hi> yet thence he muſt be gone, as an Exile or Fugitive, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to return again.</p>
            <p>Secondly, He muſt not onely leave his pleaſant Country, but alſo his pleaſant Company, his <hi>Kindred,</hi> thoſe with whom he had been acquainted, and enjoyed their Society, from his Childhood even untill old Age. Even theſe (though by Nature and long Cuſtom en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deared to him) he muſt relinquiſh at God's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, which is yet a farther Grievance to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:42122:229"/>he muſt be packing from his <hi>Father's Houſe;</hi> from him to whom natural Affection had knit him, and from thoſe who were as his Fleſh: he muſt quit even them, ſo as to put off all reſpects of Humanity and naturall Affection, (which otherwiſe had been great Impiety,) in Compliance with the Divine Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. Which is yet farther aggravated by</p>
            <p n="3">3. The <hi>Terminus ad quem,</hi> the Place to which he muſt remove. It was an uncertain Place: he was not acquainted whither he was to goe, he knew not where he ſhould reſt the Soles of his Feet; whether he were to be ſeated in the Deſarts of <hi>Arabia,</hi> or in the Land of <hi>Paleſtine;</hi> whether among ſavage people, or ſuch as feared God: onely he was to reſt ſatisfied, that he was to goe to that Place which God would ſhew him. And that was enough to him, who followed God, and was acted by an implicite Faith (not ſuch as the <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites</hi> vow to their Superiours, who often command them villanous Attempts, but) in God, who is always Righteous in his Commands, and Good unto all that <hi>walk with him and are perfect.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If any ask, why God did thus impoſe this Journey on <hi>Abraham:</hi> I anſwer, Doubtleſs it was not for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuch ſuperſtitious Ends as the Papiſts injoyn ſome men Pilgrimages, to the intent they ſhould ſatisfie for their Sins; or as other perſons by Vow undertake them, for the obtaining a greater Holineſs, or to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit thereby. For theſe, as they are undertaken with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out God's Command, ſo are they performed without his Bleſſing. But we may conceive the Reaſons of the Precept were,</p>
            <p n="1">1. To ſeparate him from that Idolatrous Country, where <hi>Nimrod</hi> (that <hi>mighty Hunter before the Lord</hi>) had erected his Kingdom: (as it is <hi>Gen.</hi> 10.8, 9, 10.) and which, it is very probable, was a Country in
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:42122:229"/>which <hi>Bel</hi> and <hi>Baal</hi> were worſhipped, and the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the true God perſecuted. Which may be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered or conjectured from what we find, both in the places before cited, and <hi>Gen.</hi> 14. as alſo from ſuch Records of Antiquity as we have in Scripture, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Authours, who make mention of the Firſt Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy of the <hi>Aſſyrians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor is it improbable, that <hi>Abraham</hi> had been a Prophet to them to warn them of the Judgments han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging over their heads, though without Succeſs; as <hi>Lot</hi> was to <hi>Sodom,</hi> though without prevailing for its Converſion.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But the chief End of God therein was, to prove <hi>Abraham,</hi> whether he would obey God: as he did af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by a more difficult Task, when he injoyned him to <hi>take his onely Son Iſaac, and to offer him as a burnt-offering on one of the Mountains which he ſhould tell him of,</hi> Gen. 22.2.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That he might of him and of his Seed raiſe up to himſelf <hi>a peculiar People,</hi> who might (as <hi>Abraham</hi> did) follow God, and depend on him entirely; and ſo be Witneſſes againſt all the Abominations which the Old Serpent had infected the World with.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That, in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Example, all Believers might ſee what their Condition that will adhere to God muſt be in this World, to wit, they muſt be in a movable eſtate, be ready to relinquiſh all at God's Command, and to be diſpoſed of as he pleaſeth.</p>
            <p>For we are to conceive, that which was here enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned was exemplary, as being ſo propounded by the Authour of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> (11.8.) And as in obeying of this Command <hi>Abraham</hi> ſhewed his Faith, not ſettling either in <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>r,</hi> or <hi>Charran,</hi> or <hi>Sichem,</hi> or <hi>Bethel,</hi> or <hi>Egypt,</hi> or any other place, as his fixed Dwelling, but moving hither and thither; and that
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:42122:230"/>not as neceſſitated thereunto, but of Choice, in Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to the Divine Will, and with expectation of a ſettled Habitation above, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.15, 16. So it is God's Intent, that <hi>Abraham</hi> ſhould be in this our Pattern to follow.</p>
            <p>We reade of <hi>Cain,</hi> when his Conſcience purſued him, that he fled <hi>from the Preſence of the Lord, and dwelt in the Land of Nod, on the Eaſt of Eden,</hi> and there <hi>built a City.</hi> He thought to relieve himſelf againſt his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed Condition (which the Terrours and the Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of his evil Conſcience haunting him brought him into) by his ſtately Building, and ſuch a voluptuous Life as carnal and worldly Enjoyments could afford, when he was deſtitute of God's Preſence with him, and the Light of God's Countenance upon him. And his Example was followed by his own Progeny, and his Brother <hi>Seth</hi>'s Race alſo for a great part.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Enoch walked with God,</hi> and <hi>he took him. Noah</hi> alſo, when <hi>the Earth was corrupt before God, was perfect in his Generation, and walked with God;</hi> and therefore at God's Appointment he prepared an Ark, to ſave himſelf and his Houſhold. And <hi>Abraham</hi> leaves his Country, <hi>ſine animo revertendi,</hi> ſo as to yield to a total Privation of all his Contents there, without any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of Regreſs into that Place, or to that Society which he had there with thoſe of his neareſt Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>The like we reade of <hi>Moſes,</hi> that he <hi>forſook Egypt,</hi> notwithſtanding his enjoyment of Dignity there, being <hi>called the Son of Pharaoh's Daughter,</hi> and thereby in a poſſibility or likelihood, if not aſſurance, of Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment unto the Throne of that moſt rich and fertile Kingdom: and choſe rather to keep Sheep in <hi>Madian,</hi> then to endure to ſee the Afflictions of God's People, without avenging them. After which he returned
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:42122:230"/>into <hi>Egypt,</hi> being commiſſionated by God, and endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Wrath of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> with the Frowardneſs of the <hi>Iſraelites.</hi> The remainder of his life he ſpent in the barren and deſolate Wilderneſs, with innumerable Vexations from thoſe unruly People which he had led out of <hi>Egypt.</hi> And all this onely becauſe it was thus appointed him by God, and <hi>having reſpect unto the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence of Reward</hi> which he ſhould give him.</p>
            <p>And indeed, God would have all his Saints to be thus minded. It is that which all the Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> by Faith in God muſt and do expect, an uncertain and ambulatory Eſtate in this World; no immutable or fixed Habitation, no Paradiſe upon Earth. <hi>David</hi> ſaith of himſelf and his Anceſtours, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39.12. <hi>I am a Stranger with thee, and a Sojourner, as all my Fathers were.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And to ſhew that the matter is not mended in this reſpect ſince <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Coming in the Fleſh: As <hi>Chriſt</hi> had no place certain, not ſo much as a place <hi>whereon to reſt his head,</hi> but went up and down, and at laſt <hi>ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red without the Gate</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> ſo ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.13, 14. it is God's determination, that <hi>we goe forth unto him without the Camp, bearing his Reproach; for here we have no continuing City, but we ſeek that one to come,</hi> even <hi>the New Jeruſalem that cometh down from God out of Heaven,</hi> Rev. 21.2, 10.</p>
            <p>And indeed there are very urgent Reaſons where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God ſo ordereth the Eſtate of his People, that it ſhould be thus changeable and unſettled, both in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of his own Glory, and their Good. On both which accounts they comply with God in his Deſign, as being regulated in their Reſolutions and Motions by Faith in God, whom they apprehend as their beſt Friend, and moſt faithfull Guide.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For firſt, hereby God refutes that malicious Slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:42122:231"/>which the Devil ſuggeſted to God againſt <hi>Job,</hi> as if he <hi>feared</hi> and ſerved <hi>God</hi> onely, becauſe God <hi>had made an Hedge about him, and about his houſe, and about all that he had on every ſide; had bleſſed the work of his hands, and his Subſtance was increaſed in the Land, Job</hi> 1.10. But God (though he permitted Satan to bereave <hi>Job</hi> of his Goods and Children and Eaſe, yet) pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Devil a Liar, and <hi>Job</hi> true-hearted, whom no Sufferings could make to <hi>curſe God.</hi> And in the like manner he ſuffers the Patience and Obedience of his Servants to be tried; whom though he keeps low, yet they own God, ſtick to him, and ſhew themſelves to be ſincere-hearted, and find him in the concluſion to be a God to be truſted. And by this their Adherence to God, and Experience of his Fidelity, they become <hi>Witneſſes for the Lord, that he is God,</hi> as it is ſaid <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43.12.</p>
            <p n="2">2. By this way of God's Providence in diſpoſing thus of his People, their Spiritual and Eternal Good is greatly promoted: for they learn hereby, <hi>not to love the World, and the things that are in the World,</hi> ſo as to chuſe their <hi>Portion</hi> in them; not to <hi>conform themſelves to</hi> the men of <hi>this World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As ſtanding Pools gather Mud, when running Springs yield clear Waters: ſo it is with men who are at Eaſe, that <hi>have no Changes,</hi> who live at Reſt and in Pleaſure. They ſurfeit of theſe earthly Dainties, are infected with worldly Thoughts, have no taſte of <hi>the Rivers of God's Pleaſures,</hi> are <hi>ſettled on their Lees,</hi> as <hi>not emptied from Veſſell to Veſſell, their Taſte remaineth in them, and their Sent is not changed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A <hi>Dives,</hi> a man that hath his Goods encreaſed, minds nothing but <hi>building his Barns,</hi> and <hi>taking his Eaſe;</hi> thinks not on his Death, on Judgment to come, or being <hi>rich towards God.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="457" facs="tcp:42122:231"/>
            <p>But the Lord, to prevent this Danger, (whereas the men of this World become as Beaſts fed to the full, as kept onely for the day of Slaughter,) orders his Sheep to be removed from Mountain to Mountain, to be in bare Paſtures; yet to have ſufficient, and, which is the chiefeſt of all, Acquaintance and Communion with the Father, and with his Son <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and his Holy Spirit.</p>
            <p>And indeed the Enjoyment of theſe Spirituall Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings doth make abundant Compenſation for the Want of that Eaſe and Pleaſure which the Grandees of the Earth have. For ſhould God let them enjoy brave Palaces, with much Abundance, and all thoſe Delights that others are Maſters of; yet theſe would be found (as <hi>Solomon</hi> proveth them to be) <hi>Vanity of Vanities,</hi> not without their mixture with Cares and Fears concerning the future, if not with <hi>Vexation of Spirit</hi> for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent: Diſeaſes and Diſcontents being incident to ſuch a ſtate of Life. And that which would moſt annoy God's Children in ſuch a Condition is, that a full E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate breeds much Sin, as Ulcers of Pride, and a <hi>Spirit of Slumber</hi> in forgetting God; beſides the Evil to which worldly Society expoſeth them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Abraham</hi> lived at more Eaſe, with much more Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and Delight, in his Tents, on the Hills of <hi>Canaan,</hi> then <hi>Lot</hi> did in <hi>Sodom,</hi> which he choſe to dwell in: where he was made a Priſoner firſt; and when reſcued by <hi>Abraham, he vexed his righteous Soul from day to day with the unclean Converſation of the</hi> Sodomites, <hi>in hearing and ſeeing their unlawfull deeds:</hi> though at laſt he were freed out of that curſed Place.</p>
            <p>And therefore every one of us is to conceive God ſpeaketh ſo to him, as he ſpake <hi>Mic.</hi> 2.10. <hi>Aniſe and depart, for this is not your Reſt, becauſe it is polluted.</hi> Nor can we <hi>be partakers of the Divine Nature,</hi> without
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:42122:232"/>
               <hi>eſcaping the Corruption that is in the World through Luſt,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Saul</hi>'s Court was not ſo good to <hi>David</hi> as the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, in which he was <hi>hunted as a Partridge on the mountains.</hi> Then he made the ſweeteſt Pſalms, and ſang them with the moſt pleaſant Melody, when, forced to leave <hi>Saul</hi>'s Court, he fled to God as to his Sanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Yea, it was better with him when he was in the Field againſt the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> then when, being at home at Reſt and Eaſe, he walked on the Roof of his houſe, and ſaw <hi>Bathſheba.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sure this preſent Eſtate, with all its Advantages, is but a tranſitory Condition; <hi>The World paſſeth away, and the Luſt thereof:</hi> and therefore it is not ſo eligible as the Favour of God here; much leſs as the <hi>beholding of his Face in Righteouſneſs</hi> hereafter.</p>
            <p>And the worſt Condition a Saint can be in, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends on God, and follows him, (as <hi>Abraham</hi> did,) is but a Storm: <hi>Nubecula eſt, citò tranſibit;</hi> it will quickly blow over; as that Holy man ſaid of the <hi>Arian</hi> Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution. <hi>This light Affliction, which is but for a moment,</hi> will <hi>work for us</hi> (if we <hi>walk humbly with our God</hi>) <hi>a far more exceeding and eternall weight of Glory: While we look not at the things which are ſeen, but at the things which are not ſeen: for the things which are ſeen are Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall; but the things which are not ſeen are Eternall,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.17, 18.</p>

               <p>And now, I beſeech you, take this matter into your ſerious Conſideration. If you be indeed Children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and expect to be in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Boſome, the Courſe that God took with <hi>Abraham</hi> muſt not be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſant to you.

               <p>You that give your minds to riſe at Court, or to be Rich in the City; to build fair Houſes, to fill them with coſtly Furniture, to ſtore them with the moſt dainty Proviſion; to goe in the braveſt Attire, and to mind your Eaſe and Delight; bethink your ſelves how ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table this is with the Divine Contrivance, and the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of Saints.</p>
               <p>I deny not but an <hi>Abraham</hi> may be rich, and yet bleſſed; a <hi>David</hi> may be great, and yet happy. God may (and, I doubt not, doth) <hi>chuſe</hi> ſome (though <hi>not many</hi>) Rich and <hi>Great</hi> in this world, to be Heirs of <hi>the Kingdom which he hath prepared for them that love him.</hi> But then it muſt be ſo, that they love not their Riches, nor their Greatneſs, but God; that they be as <hi>Abraham</hi> was, ready to leave all for God, to obey God in the harſheſt Commands, to wait upon God with Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience for his Help. They muſt have, as <hi>Moſes</hi> had, a Will reſolved <hi>to ſuffer Affliction with God's People, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then to injoy the Pleaſures of Sin for a ſeaſon;</hi> to <hi>eſteem the Reproach of Chriſt greater Riches then the Treaſures of Egypt.</hi> They muſt be as <hi>Chriſt</hi> was, not <hi>of</hi> the World, though <hi>in</hi> the World; not from <hi>beneath,</hi> but from <hi>above;</hi> having God's Glory in their Eye, <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Example as their Loadſtone; <hi>ſeeking the things above, where Chriſt ſitteth at the right hand of God,</hi> and directing all their Motions and Affections towards Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Heavenly things.</p>
               <p>I preſs you not to <hi>ſell all that you have, and give to the Poor,</hi> as <hi>Chriſt</hi> did the young man whom he loved: nor to <hi>ſell your Lands,</hi> as the Primitive Chriſtians did, and <hi>lay them down at the Apoſtles feet.</hi> Yet I muſt tell you, that if you will follow <hi>Chriſt,</hi> you muſt, <hi>(in prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratione Animi)</hi> in the purpoſe of your Heart, doe

               <p>I do account of the Friers Vows of voluntary Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty, perpetuall Continency, and regular Obedience, ſo far from true Sanctity, that they are rather mere Snares, and like thoſe Services of which God ſaid by the Prophet, <hi>Quis quaeſivit haec de manibus veſtris?

            <head>A MEDITATION on GOD'S MERCY, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Subject of moſt of the SER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MONS herein contained.</head>
            <p>WHEN we ſeek after God, we conſult with his Works: but when we ſtudy to know what he is, we have recourſe unto thoſe Notions which are above his Works. The Creature helps us to find him out: but his Power, Infinity, and Mercy, inſtruct us to underſtand him. Neither do theſe Attributes equally ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint us with him. His Power informs us that he is God; but his Mercy much more. For by his Power he onely conquered that Difficulty which Nature preſented him with in her firſt Principle, <hi>(Nothing:)</hi> but by his Mercy he overcomes Himſelf. It ſometimes reverſeth the Sentence paſt againſt a Nation; and ſo it makes him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre the imputation of Mutability: Sometimes it pulls back the ſtretched-out Arm, and, like the Angel that laid hold on <hi>Abraham,</hi> violently detains the execution of his Fury; and ſo it upbraideth him with Impotency. It is not then enough to ſay that it exceeds all his Works, unleſs we adde, it is that alſo whereby he is ſubdued unto Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
            <p>As God, who is our utmoſt Aim, having placed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf at the Journey's end, is All Mercy; ſo are the Ways that lead unto him: His <hi>Ways are Mercy and Truth.</hi> And as he is onely found by thoſe that ſeek him: ſo is he onely ſought for truly by thoſe that travell in this Way. <hi>The Mercifull,</hi> and they onely, <hi>ſhall find Mercy.</hi> The
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:42122:234"/>Light communicates its Glory unto that Eye alone which hath a native Light and Splendour to entertain it: even ſo doth God reach out his Mercy unto that Soul which is before made capable by an innate Tenderneſs and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion.</p>
            <p>To forgive and to have Compaſſion are the peculiar Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of Mercy. If I forgive mine Enemy, I have Mercy on my ſelf; for to him that forgiveth, much alſo ſhall be forgiven: But if I have Compaſſion on the Diſtreſſed, I have pity on my Saviour; for 'tis him I feed, I cloath, in the perſons of the Hungry and of the Naked.</p>
            <p>God hath given unto men a Nature which inclineth them unto Pity; and therefore Cruelty is a Vice of the Will's begetting. Since then Nature hath no Inclination bad enough, out of which it may ſpawn ſo vile a Brood: I will not be at ſo much pains as to force the Soil, that a Weed may grow; nor love that Sin, which will not be entertained unleſs I diſclaim my Nature.</p>
            <p>God once commanded Sacrifices, that he might have Mercy upon Men; and yet he was willing to have ſpared them that, if they would have ſpared one another. <hi>I will have Mercy, and not Sacrifice,</hi> was his demand of old; but now much more: for ſince he hath taken away the Law of Sacrifices, it remains that we imploy all our Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience in the obſervance of that Law which is left behind, which is the Law of Charity. God hath abated ſomething of his own Worſhip, that we might have more leiſure to perform thoſe Duties which reſpect one another.</p>
            <p>If we would have God commune with us, as once he did with the <hi>Jews</hi> from his Mercy-ſeat, it will be firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of us, that, like the Cherubins there placed, we
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:42122:234"/>carry our Faces one towards another, not turning aſide from the Diſtreſſed, nor obliquely glancing upon any as averſe from Peace. God ſeems to inſtruct us by that Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick in the Ark, that he then makes his Approach to us from his Mercy-ſeat, when we turn face to face, that is, when we are alike minded one towards another.</p>
            <p>God, that he might reconcile his Juſtice to his Mercy, and ſo ſave the delinquent Creature, became ſevere to himſelf: ſo much he loved us, that he ſeemed to love himſelf leſs. If we cannot reach the height of this Docu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which is, to die for an Enemy; yet we may goe ſo far, as not to incurre our Deſtruction by an affected Hatred.</p>
            <p>As God's Mercy is tranſcendent, and runs through all his other Attributes; ſo ought ours to be: our very Acts of Juſtice and ſevereſt Rigour muſt be Acts of Mercy. As it is our Compaſſion to the Body that makes us cut off a gangraened Member: ſo muſt our Tenderneſs of the whole, ſeaſon that Severity which is directed againſt a private perſon.</p>
            <p>The whole Frame and Courſe of things ſeem to leſſon us to this Duty. If we look towards that Heaven which muſt be the Seat and Manſion of the Saints, 'tis bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and uncomprehended: ſo much delights his Mercy to exſpatiate it ſelf, that it will not be confined: whereas his Wrath and Vengeance are content with a narrow Room for the execution of his Juſtice. He hath made Heaven of a vaſt Capacity, which betokens an Infinite Goodneſs: but the Place of Torments hath he bounded with ſtreight Dimenſions, leſt his avenging Juſtice ſhould be exalted above his Mercy in the largeneſs of its Dominion. If God have ſcarce afforded his juſt Vengeance a Point or
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:42122:235"/>Angle in this great <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſe; then ought not Man, in ſo ſmall a Room as his Heart, give any entertainment to unjuſt Cruelty or Hardneſs; but ſtudy rather to enlarge it, that he may take in a greater meaſure of that Mercy, whoſe Property is to be boundleſs and tranſcendent.</p>
